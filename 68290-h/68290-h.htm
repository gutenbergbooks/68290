<p>“The incidents are of great interest, well-imagined, and admirably
carried out. But the notable feature of the book is the rare charm of
its literary expression. The language is full of grace and wit and
delicate sensibility. To read is to be beguiled.”&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>

<p>“The pages of ‘Throckmorton’ are alive with picturesque
sketches. Its humor is never forced, and its pathos is never overdone.
It is a novel to linger over.”&mdash;<i>The Critic.</i></p>

<p>“A charming story. The author has used good English, and the
reader yields to the fascination of her style.”&mdash;<i>The Book Buyer.</i></p>

<p>“There is an unmistakable cleverness in this collection of short
stories.”&mdash;<i>Boston Literary World.</i></p>

<p>“Miss Seawell has a brisk and prolific fancy, and a turn for the
odd and fantastic, while she is Past Master in the use of negro dialect
and the production of tales of plantation life and manners. All these
stories are spirited, well marked by local color, and written with skill
and ingenuity.”&mdash;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>

the War of 1812. With Six full-page Illustrations.

gold and colors. $1.00.</p>

<p>“The story is told in a breezy, pleasant style that can not fail to
capture the fancy of young readers, and imparts much historical
knowledge at the same time, while the illustrations will help the
understanding of the events described. It is an excellent book for
boys, and even the girls will be interested in it.”&mdash;<i>Brooklyn
Standard-Union.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A provincial</span> Virginia race-course is an excellent
place to observe a people which has preserved
its distinctiveness as well as the Virginians. So
far, they have escaped that general and fatiguing
likeness which prevails in most of the universe these
days.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Campdown race-course, on a
golden day in October, looked like itself and nothing
else. The track had started out with the intention
of making a perfect ellipse, but meeting a
steep incline, it saved the trouble of bringing up
the grade, by boldly avoiding the obstacle&mdash;so the
winning post was considerably nearer the half-mile
than the starting post was. Nobody objected to
a little thing like this, though. The Virginians are
good-natured creatures, and seldom bother about
trifles.</p>

<p>It was the fall meeting of the Campdown Jockey
Club&mdash;a famous institution “befo’ the war.”</p>

<p>At this time the great awakening had not come&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
war was not long over. For these people, had
they but known it, the end of the war really meant
the end of the world&mdash;but the change was too stupendous
for any human mind to grasp all at once.
There came a period of shock before the pain was
felt, when the people, groping amid the ruins of
their social fabric, patched it up a little here and a
little there. They resumed in a dazed and incomplete
way their old amusements, their old habits
and ways of life. They mortgaged their lands&mdash;all
that was left to them&mdash;with great coolness and a
superstitious faith in the future&mdash;Virginians are
prone to hanker after mortgages&mdash;and spent the
money untroubled by any reflections where any
more was to come from when that was gone.</p>

<p>They were intense pleasure lovers. In that
happy afternoon haze in which they had lived until
the storm broke, pleasure was the chief end of man.
So now, the whole county turned out to see two or
three broken-down hacks, and a green colt or two,
race for the mythical stakes. It is true, a green
silk bag, embroidered in gold, with the legend
“$300” hung aloft on a tall pole, for the sweepstakes,
but it did not contain three hundred dollars,
but about one-half of it in gold, and a check drawn
by the president of the Jockey Club against the
treasurer for the balance. Most of the members
had not paid their dues, and the treasurer didn’t
know where the money was to come from, nor the
president either, for that matter; but it takes a
good deal to discount a Virginian’s faith in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
future. The public, too, was fully acquainted with
the state of affairs, and the fact that there was any
gold at all in the bag, would eventually be in the
nature of a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>The people, in carriages, or on horseback, bore
little resemblance to the usual country gathering.
They were gentlepeople tinged with rusticity. All
of them had good, high sounding Anglo-Saxon
names. There was some magnificence of an antique
pattern. One huge family ark was drawn
by four sleek old horses, with a venerable black
coachman on the box, and inside a superb old lady
with a black veil falling over her white hair. There
were but two really correct equipages in the field.
One was a trim, chocolate-colored victoria, with
brown horses and a chocolate-colored coachman to
match. In it sat a showy woman, with a profusion
of dazzling blonde hair, and beside her was an immaculately
well dressed blonde man. The turnout
looked like a finely finished photograph among a
lot of dingy old family portraits.</p>

<p>The other carriage that would have passed muster
was a large and handsome landau, respectfully
called “the Isleham carriage,” and in it sat Colonel
Berkeley and his daughter Olivia. The Colonel
was a genuine Virginia colonel, and claimed to be
the last man in the State to wear a ruffled shirt
bosom. A billowy expanse of thread cambric ruffles
rushed out of his waistcoat; his snow white hair was
carefully combed down upon his coat collar. At
the carriage door stood his double&mdash;an elderly negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
as grizzled as his master, to whom he bore that
curious resemblance that comes of fifty years association.
This resemblance was very much increased
when Colonel Berkeley’s back was turned, and in the
privacy of the kitchen, Petrarch&mdash;or more commonly
Pete&mdash;pished and pshawed and railed and swore in
the colonel’s most inimitable manner. Each, too,
possessed a type of aggressive piety, which in
Colonel Berkeley took the form of a loud declaration
that a gentleman, in order to be a gentleman,
must be a member of the Episcopal Church. This
once accomplished, the Colonel was willing to allow
liberally for the weaknesses of human nature,
and considered too great strictness of behavior as
“deuced ungentlemanlike, begad.” Petrarch regarded
himself as a second Isaiah the prophet, and
a vessel of election&mdash;having reached the stage of
perfectibility&mdash;a usual thing in the experience of a
genuine African. The Colonel described Petrarch
as “that infernal rascally boy of mine,” and this
“boy” was the one individual he had never been
able to overawe or silence. Possibly an exception
might be made to this in Miss Olivia, who sitting up,
slim and straight and pretty, was treated by her father
with elaborate old-fashioned courtesy. Colonel
Berkeley was in a particularly happy and virtuous
frame of mind on this day. This was his first appearance
in public since his return from Europe,
where a serious bodily injury had kept him during
the whole four years of the war. He gloried in
the consciousness that he was no renegade, but had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
returned to the sacred soil as soon as he possibly
could, when he might have been enjoying himself
elsewhere. When the Colonel said “the State of
Virginia,” he really meant the whole planetary system.
Nevertheless, two weeks in his beloved Virginia
had bored him dreadfully, and he was “more
orkarder,” as Petrarch expressed it, than any other
two weeks of his whole life. The Campdown races
he hailed as a godsend. He had a good competence
left, in spite of having sent orders to his
agents to convert lands, stocks, bonds, and everything,
into Confederate securities&mdash;cotton bonds,
Confederate gunboat stock, anything in which the
State of Virginia was bound up. As far as in him
lay, he had made ducks and drakes of a splendid
fortune, from the finest and most disinterested motives
that ever inspired a mistaken old gentleman,
but fate had befriended him against his will. An
investment at the North that the colonel had vainly
tried to throw in the general wreck, had escaped
confiscation, and had increased, a hundredfold in
value. His orders to sell half of Isleham, his family
place, for Confederate money, had arrived too
late for his agent to carry it out. He had done the
handsome thing, as it was esteemed, and after having
practiced the strictest virtue, he was rewarded
with all the pleasures that are commonly supposed
to be the reward of vice.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, papa,” the young girl said to
him at once, “that we should go up on the grand
stand? It might look a little&mdash;a little standoffish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
for us to remain here&mdash;and the county
people&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Virginians inherit from their English ancestry,
a vast and preposterous respect for their county
people&mdash;and Miss Olivia Berkeley, fresh from Paris
and London, was more anxious that no fault should
be found with her by these out-of-the-way provincials
than any of the fine people she had met
during a considerable transatlantic experience. So
was Colonel Berkeley&mdash;but there was a fly in his
ointment.</p>

<p>“I would with pleasure, my love, but damme if
those Hibbses are not sitting up on the stand
along with their betters&mdash;and I won’t rub elbows
with the Hibbses. It’s everywhere the same.
Society is so infernally mixed now that I am always
expecting to meet my tailor at dinner. I thought
certainly, in old Virginia, the people would know
how to keep the canaille in their places, and there,
by George, sits a family like the Hibbses staring
me in the face.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Olivia, smiling. “It’s everywhere
the same&mdash;you are bound to meet some of the
Hibbses everywhere in the world&mdash;so we might as
well do the right thing in spite of them. Petrarch,
open the carriage door.”</p>

<p>The Colonel, with old-fashioned gallantry, assisted
his daughter to alight, and giving her his arm, they
crossed the track in full view of the grand stand,
and went up the rickety wooden stairs at the end.</p>

<p>At no period in her life had Olivia Berkeley felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
herself so thoroughly on exhibition as then. Her
figure, her air&mdash;both of which were singularly graceful
and refined&mdash;her gown which was Paris-made&mdash;all
were minutely examined by hundreds of eyes
that had not seen her since, as a pretty, half-grown
girl, she went to church and paid visits under the
charge of a demure governess. After they had
crossed the white track, they were greeted by
numerous gentlemen who sauntered back and forth
about the quarter-stretch. Colonel Berkeley was
elaborately gracious, and Olivia was by nature
affable&mdash;to all except the Hibbses. But when
they passed that inoffending family, the Colonel
stalked on pointedly oblivious, and Olivia’s slight
bow was not warming or cheering.</p>

<p>People moved up to shake hands with them&mdash;girls
of Olivia’s age, soft voiced, matronly women,
elderly men, a little shaky and broken, as all the old
men looked after the war&mdash;and young men with
something of the camp hanging to them still.
Olivia was all grace, kindness, and tact. She had
forgotten nobody.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Petrarch, who had followed them,
managed to edge up to her and whisper:</p>

<p>“Miss ’Livy, ain’t dat ar Marse French Pembroke
an’ he b’rer Miles? Look a-yander by de
aige o’ de bench.”</p>

<p>Olivia glanced that way, and a slight wave of
color swept over her face&mdash;and at that moment
“Marse French’s b’rer Miles” turned his full face
toward her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>He was a mere lad, of eighteen at the utmost.
One side of his face, as she had first seen his profile,
was of the purest Greek beauty. But on the other
side, a shot had done dreadful work. One eye was
drawn out of place. A horrid gash in the cheek
remained, and one side of the mouth was painfully
disfigured. On the same side, an arm was
missing.</p>

<p>A torrent of pity almost overwhelmed Olivia as
she looked at the boy&mdash;her little playmate in years
gone by. And then the elder brother caught her
eye, and bowed and smiled. He did not possess
the beauty that had once belonged to Miles. He
was dark and tanned, and his features had a manly
irregularity. But he stood up straight and tall, and
had the figure of a soldier. In a moment or two
Olivia was shaking hands with Miles, looking straight
and boldly into his face, as if there was nothing
remarkable there. But just as she touched French
Pembroke’s hand, the blonde woman in the victoria
came within her line of vision.</p>

<p>Olivia threw up her head, and greeted Pembroke
with a kind of chilling sweetness. But this all dissolved
toward Miles.</p>

<p>“How delightful to see you again,” she said. “I
suppose I shall have to say Mr. Miles now, although
I never can think of you as anything but a dear little
tormenting boy.”</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile&mdash;his smile was a mere contortion&mdash;came
into Miles’ face&mdash;and while he talked,
he thrust his one hand into his trousers pocket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
with a gesture of boyish shyness. Olivia thought
she heard the tell-tale rattle of marbles in the
pocket.</p>

<p>“I’ve&mdash;I’ve been a soldier since I saw you,” he
said, with a boy’s mixture of pride and diffidence.</p>

<p>“So I hear,” answered Olivia, with a pretty air of
severity, “ran away from school, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Miles, his diffidence disappearing
before his pride. “I was big enough to carry a
musket. Though I wasn’t but sixteen, I was taller
than the captain of my company. Soldiering was
fun until&mdash;until&mdash;.” He began to blush furiously,
but kept on after a moment. “I didn’t mind sleeping
in the mud, or anything. A man oughtn’t to
mind that sort of thing, Olivia&mdash;if you’ll let me call
you Olivia.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” replied Olivia gayly. “Do
you think I want to appear any older than I am?”
Then she turned to Pembroke and said, “I was
sorry not to have seen you the day you came to
Isleham. We met last in Paris.”</p>

<p>“I hope to see as much of Isleham as we did in
the old days,” answered Pembroke. His voice was
rather remarkable, it was so clear and well modulated.</p>

<p>“I hope,” began Miles, stammering a little, “that&mdash;that
you and the Colonel understood my not&mdash;why
I didn’t come to see you in Paris.”</p>

<p>“Not fully,” answered Olivia, pleasantly. “You
must come over to Isleham and explain it&mdash;if you
can. Have you seen papa yet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“I see him now,” said Pembroke with a smile,
“shaking hands with Mrs. Peyton.”</p>

<p>Olivia smiled too. There had been a flirtation
between Mrs. Peyton and Colonel Berkeley forty
odd years before, and as everything that happened
in the community was perfectly well known by
everybody else, the episode had crystallized into a
tradition. Colonel Berkeley had been known to
swear that Sally Peyton in her youth was a jilt.
Mrs. Peyton always said that Tom Berkeley was not
to be depended on. The Colonel was saying to
Mrs. Peyton in his grandest tones:</p>

<p>“Madam, Time has passed you by.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear Colonel,” responded Mrs. Peyton
with a quizzical look at Colonel Berkeley’s elaborate
toilet and flamboyant shirt ruffles, “we can’t
cross the dead line of sixty without showing it.
Even art cannot conceal it.”</p>

<p>“Just like Sally Peyton’s sharp tongue,” the
colonel growled sotto voce&mdash;while a suppressed
guffaw from Pete on the verge of the group, showed
the remark was not lost on that factotum.</p>

<p>“And Petrarch too,” cried Mrs. Peyton in her
fine, jovial old voice, holding out her hand.</p>

<p>Pete shuffled up and took her hand in his black
paw.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Miss Sally. Lordy, marster done tole
de truf&mdash;you looks jes ez young an’ chipper&mdash;How’s
Mandy?”</p>

<p>“Mandy has lost her senses since old Abe
Lincoln made you all free. She’s left me and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
gone to Richmond to go to school&mdash;the old
idiot.”</p>

<p>“Hi! I allers did like Mandy, but I ain’t got no
use fer dem niggers dat kin read ’n write. Readin’
an’ writin’ is fer white folks.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you black rascal,” roared the Colonel,
nevertheless highly delighted. “Madam, may I
present my daughter&mdash;Olivia, my child.”</p>

<p>Olivia came up, and Mrs. Peyton kissed her
affectionately, but not before a rapid glance which
took in all there was of her.</p>

<p>“Like her sainted mother,” began the Colonel,
dramatically.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” briskly answered Mrs. Peyton. “A
Berkeley all over, if ever I saw one. Child, I hope
you are as nice as you are pretty.”</p>

<p>“Nobody ever told me I wasn’t nice,” responded
Olivia with a smile.</p>

<p>“And not spoiled by your foreign travels?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least.”</p>

<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! goes the saddling bell.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” says Olivia laughing.
“Papa has entered Dashaway. You know he is
twelve years old, and as Petrarch says, he hasn’t
any wind left&mdash;but papa wouldn’t listen to anybody.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s Tom Berkeley all over. Ah, my
dear, I could tell you something that happened
forty-two years ago, in which I promise you, I got
the better of your father.”</p>

<p>The horses by this time are coming out. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
are an ordinary looking lot except one spanking
roan, the property of the despised Hibbses, and
Dashaway, a gray thoroughbred, a good deal like
Colonel Berkeley himself, but like him, with certain
physical defects. The gray has a terrific wheeze,
and the hair on his fetlocks is perfectly white. But
he holds his head up gallantly, and gives a tremendous
snort which nearly shakes the mite of a
darkey off his back. All the jockeys are negro
boys. There is no pool-selling, but the gentlemen
make bets among themselves and with the ladies.
The transactions if small, are exciting.</p>

<p>Colonel Berkeley’s presence hardly prevents a
laugh as the gray ambles past the grand stand, snorting
and blowing like a porpoise. The Colonel, however,
has unshaken confidence in Dashaway. Is he
not of the best blood of Sir Henry, and didn’t he win
fourteen hundred dollars for the Colonel on the Campdown
course the year before the war? Colonel
Berkeley knows a horse well enough&mdash;but to know
horses and to know one’s own horse are two things.</p>

<p>Colonel Berkeley, leaning over the fence, is giving
his directions, in a loud voice, to the little darkey,
who is nearly ashy with fright. He knows what is
expected of him, and he knows Dashaway’s deficiencies.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, you are to make the running from the
half-mile post. Keep well up with the horse in the
lead, but don’t attempt to pass him until you have
turned the half-mile.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah,” answers the small jockey, trembling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
“But Dashaway, he c’yarn run much, sah, ’thout
blowin’, an’&mdash;an’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Zounds, sirrah, do you mean to instruct me
about my own horse? Now listen you young imp.
Use the whip moderately, Dashaway comes of
stock that won’t stand whip and spur. If he runs
away, just give him his head, and if you don’t
remember every word I tell you, by the Lord
Harry, I’ll make you dance by the time you are
out of the saddle!”</p>

<p>“Good Gord A’mighty, marster,” puts in Petrarch.
“Dashaway, he ain’ never gwi’ run away.
He too ole, an’ he ain’t strong ’nuff&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Good Gad, sir, was ever a man so tormented
by such a set of black rascals? Hold your tongue&mdash;don’t
let me hear another word from you, not
another word, sir.”</p>

<p>The jockey, who takes the Colonel’s words at
their full value, which Petrarch discounts liberally,
begins to stutter with fright.</p>

<p>“M&mdash;m&mdash;marster, ef I jes’ kin git Dashaway
’long wid de res’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence, sir,” shouts the Colonel, “and remember
every word I tell you, or&mdash;&mdash;” Colonel Berkeley’s
appalling countenance and uplifted cane complete
the rest.</p>

<p>Dashaway is not only conspicuously the worst of
the lot, but the most troublesome. Half a dozen
good starts might be made but for Dashaway. At
last the flag drops. “Go!” yells the starter, and
the horses are off. Dashaway takes his place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
promptly in the rear, and daylight steadily widens
between him and the last horse. As the field
comes thundering down the homestretch the spanking
roan well in the lead, Dashaway is at least a
quarter of a mile behind, blowing like a whale, and
the jockey is whipping furiously, his arm flying
around like a windmill. The Colonel is fairly dancing
with rage.</p>

<p>Colonel Berkeley is not the man to lose a race
to the Hibbses with composure, and Petrarch’s
condolences, reminiscences, prophecies and deductions
were not of a consolatory character.</p>

<p>“Ole Marse, I done tole you, Dashaway warn’t
fitten ter run, at de very startment. He been a
mighty good horse, but he c’yarn snuffle de battle
fum befo’, an’ say Hay! hay! like de horse in de
Bible no mo’.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, sir&mdash;shut up. Religion and horse racing
don’t mix,” roars the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Naw suh, dey doan! When de horse racin’
folks is burnin’ in de lake full er brimstone an’ sulphur,
de ’ligious folks will be rastlin’ wid de golden
harps&mdash;” Petrarch’s sermon is cut ruthlessly short
by Colonel Berkeley suddenly catching sight of
the unfortunate jockey in a vain attempt to get
out of the way. But his day of reckoning had
come. Petrarch had collared him, and the Colonel
proceeded to give him what he called a dressing-down,
liberally punctuated with flourishes of a bamboo
cane.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you,” he was shouting to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
unhappy youngster, “to make the running&mdash;<i>to
make the running, hay</i>?”</p>

<p>“M&mdash;m&mdash;marster, I ’clar to Gord, I thot’ Dashaway
wuz gw’in’ to drap ’fo I git him to de half-mile
pos’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Drap</i>&mdash;you scoundrel, <i>drap</i>! The blood of
Sir Henry <i>drap</i>! You confounded rascal, you
pulled that horse,” etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peyton laughed. “It does my heart good
to hear Tom Berkeley raging like that. It reminds
me that we are not all dead or changed, as it seems
to me sometimes. Your father and I have had passages-at-arms
in <i>my</i> time, I can tell you, Olivia.”</p>

<p>Clang! presently again. It is the saddling bell
once more. But there is no Dashaway in this race.
Nevertheless it is very exciting. There are half a
dozen horses, and after the start is made it looks to
be anybody’s race. Even as they come pounding
down the straight sweep of the last two furlongs, it
would be hard to pick out the probable winner.
The people on the grand stand have gone wild&mdash;they
are shouting names, the men waving their
hats, the women standing up on benches to see
as two or three horses gradually draw away from
the others, and a desperate struggle is promised
within the last thirty lengths. And just at this
moment, when everybody’s attention is fixed on
the incoming horses, French Pembroke has slipped
across the track and is speaking to the blonde
woman in the victoria. His face does not look
pleasant. He has chosen this moment, when all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
attention is fixed on something else to speak to her,
so that it will not be observed&mdash;and although he
adopts the subterfuge, he despises it. Nor does the
blonde woman fail to see through it. She does not
relish being spoken to on the sly as it were.
Nothing, however, disturbs the cheerful urbanity
of the gentleman by her side. He gets out of the
carriage and grasps Pembroke by the hand. He
calls him “mon cher” a vulgar mode of address
which Pembroke resents with a curt “Good-morning,
Mr. Ahlberg,” and then he lifts his hat to the
lady whom he calls Madame Koller. “Why did
you not come before?” she asks, “you might have
known it would be dull enough.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know everybody here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Madame Koller, sighing profoundly.
“I remember all of them&mdash;and most of
the men have called. Some of them are so strange.
They stay all day when they come. And such
queer carriages.”</p>

<p>“And the costumes. The costumes!” adds Mr.
Ahlberg on the ground.</p>

<p>Pembroke felt a sense of helpless indignation.
He answered Mr. Ahlberg by turning his back, and
completely ignoring that excessively stylish person.</p>

<p>“You must remember the four years’ harrowing
they have been through,” he says to Madame
Koller. “But they are so thoroughly established
in their own esteem,” he adds with a little malice,
“that they are indifferent even to the disapproval
of Madame Koller. I am glad to see you looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
so well. I must, however, leave you now, as I am
one of the managers, and must look after the weighing.”</p>

<p>“Now you are going away because I have been
disagreeable,” remarked Madame Koller reproachfully.
“And poor Ahlberg&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Must take care of you, and do his best to amuse
you,” answered Pembroke with a laugh and a look
that classed Ahlberg with Madame’s poodle or her
parrot. “Good-bye,” and in a minute he was
gone. Madame Koller looked sulky. Mr. Ahlberg’s
good humor and composure were perfectly
unruffled.</p>

<p>Hardly any one noticed Pembroke’s little expedition
except Mrs. Peyton and Olivia Berkeley. Mrs.
Peyton mounted a pair of large gold spectacles, and
then remarked to Olivia:</p>

<p>“My dear, there’s French Pembroke talking to
my niece, Eliza Peyton&mdash;” Mrs. Peyton was a Peyton
before she married one&mdash;“Madame Elise
Koller she now calls herself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you saw a good deal of her in Paris,
and my sister-in-law, Sarah Scaife that was&mdash;now
Madame Schmidt. She showed me the dear
departed’s picture the other day&mdash;a horrid little
wretch he looked, while my brother, Edmund Peyton,
was the handsomest young man in the county.”</p>

<p>“We saw Madame Koller quite often,” said
Olivia. Mrs. Peyton was amazingly clever as a
mind reader, and saw in a moment there was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
love lost between Olivia Berkeley and Madame
Koller.</p>

<p>“And that Mr. Ahlberg. Sarah Scaife says he is
a cousin of Eliza’s&mdash;I mean Elise’s&mdash;husband.”</p>

<p>“I should think if anybody knew the facts in
the case it would be Sarah Scaife, as you call her,”
replied Olivia laughing. “I believe he is a very
harmless kind of a man.”</p>

<p>At that Mrs. Peyton took off her spectacles and
looked at Olivia keenly.</p>

<p>“I hate to believe you are a goose,” she said,
good-naturedly; “but you must be very innocent.
Harmless! That is the very thing that man is
not.”</p>

<p>“So papa says, but I think it comes from Mr.
Ahlberg eating asparagus with his fingers and not
knowing how to play whist, or something of the
kind. I have seen him on and off at watering
places, and in Paris for two or three years. I never
saw him do anything that wasn’t quite right&mdash;and I
never heard anything against him except what you
and papa say&mdash;and that is rather indefinite.”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t observe my niece with French
Pembroke, did you?”</p>

<p>Olivia Berkeley’s face turned a warm color. Such
very plain spoken persons as Mrs. Peyton were a
little embarrassing. But just then came the sound
of the Colonel’s voice, raised at a considerable distance.</p>

<p>“Olivia, my love&mdash;God bless my soul&mdash;Mrs. Peyton&mdash;there’s
that charming niece of yours&mdash;what a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
creature she was when she lived in this county as
Eliza Peyton&mdash;a regular stunner, begad&mdash;I must go
and speak to her&mdash;and my particular friend, Ahlberg&mdash;excuse
me a moment, my love.” Colonel
Berkeley stalked across the track, receiving all the
attention which Pembroke had tried to avoid.
Life in his beloved Virginia had almost driven the
Colonel distracted by its dullness, and he could not
but welcome a fellow creature from the outside.
He buttoned his light overcoat trimly around his
still handsome figure, and bowed majestically when
he reached the carriage. Madame Koller returned
the bow with a brilliant smile. She was beginning
to feel very much alone, albeit she was in her
native county, and she welcomed Colonel Berkeley
as a deliverer. Evidently she soothed him about
Dashaway. Pembroke, passing by, heard scraps
like the following:</p>

<p>“I have seen just such things at the Grand
Prix&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Madame, the infernal system here of putting up
irresponsible negro boys&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I could see he had a superb stride&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dashaway, Madame Koller, comes from the
very best stock in the State of Virginia.”</p>

<p>The day wore on, and by dint of spinning things
out most unconscionably it was dusk of the clear
autumn evening before the cavalcade took the
dusty white road toward home. In “the Isleham
carriage” Colonel Berkeley leaned back and waxed
confidential with his daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“My dear, Eliza Peyton&mdash;Madame Koller I
should say&mdash;is what you young sprigs call green&mdash;excessively
green. She imagines because I am old
I am a fool. And that precious scamp, Ahlberg&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why do you call him a scamp, papa?”</p>

<p>“Why do I call Petrarch an African?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Peyton seems to have some kind of a prejudice
to Mr. Ahlberg, too.”</p>

<p>“Aha, trust Sally Peyton to see for herself.
She’s devilish tricky, is Sally Peyton&mdash;not that I
have any cause to complain of it&mdash;none whatever.
She’s very sharp. But we’ll go and call some day
on Eli&mdash;Madame Koller. She’s not bad company
for the country&mdash;and I’ve heard she could sing,
too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we will go,” answered Olivia, suppressing
a yawn. “It’s in the country, as you say.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Does</span> anybody ever ask what becomes of the
<i>prime donne</i> who break down early? Madame
Koller could have told something about their miseries,
from the first struggling steps up to the pinnacle
when they can fight with managers, down
again to the point when the most dreadful sound
that nature holds&mdash;so she thought&mdash;a hiss&mdash;laid
them figuratively among the dead. Nature generally
works methodically, but in Madame Koller’s
case, she seemed to take a delight in producing
grapes from thorns. Without one atom of artistic
heredity, surroundings or atmosphere to draw upon,
Eliza Peyton had come into the world an artist.
She had a voice, and she grew up with the conviction
that there was nothing in the world but voices
and pianos. It is not necessary to repeat how in her
girlhood, by dint of her widowed mother marrying a
third rate German professor, she got to Munich and
to Milan&mdash;nor how the voice, at first astonishingly
pure and beautiful, suddenly lost its pitch, then disappeared
altogether. It is true that after a time it
came back to her partially. She could count on it
for an hour at a time, but no more. Of course
there was no longer any career for her, and she
nearly went crazy with grief&mdash;then she consoled
herself with M. Koller, an elderly Swiss manufacturer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
In some way, although she was young and
handsome and accomplished, she found in her continental
travels that the best Americans and
English avoided the Kollers. This she rashly
attributed to the fact of her having had a brief professional
career, and she became as anxious to
conceal it as she had once been anxious to pursue
it. M. Koller was a hypochondriac, and went
from Carlsbad to Wiesbaden, from Wiesbaden to
Hyéres, from Hyéres to Aix-les-Bains. He was
always fancying himself dying, but one day at
Vichy, death came quite unceremoniously and
claimed him just as he had made up his mind to get
well. Thus Eliza Koller found herself a widow,
still young and handsome, with a comfortable fortune,
and a negative mother to play propriety.
She went straight to Paris as soon as the period of
her mourning was over. It was then toward the
latter part of the civil war in America, and there
were plenty of Southerners in Paris. There she
met Colonel Berkeley and Olivia, and for the first
time in her adult life, she had a fixed place in
society&mdash;there was a circle in which she was
known.</p>

<p>What most troubled her, was what rôle to take
up&mdash;whether she should be an American, a French
woman, an Italian, a German, or a cosmopolitan.
For she was like all, and was distinctively none.
In Paris at that time, she met a cousin of her late
husband&mdash;Mr. Ahlberg, also a Swiss, but in the
Russian diplomatic service. He was a sixth Secretary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
of Legation, and had hard work making his
small salary meet his expenses. He was a handsome
man, very blonde, and extremely well-dressed.
Madame Koller often wondered if his tailor were
not a very confiding person. For Ahlberg’s part,
he sincerely liked his cousin, as he called her, and
quite naturally slipped into the position of a friend
of the family. Everything perhaps would have
been arranged to his satisfaction, if just at that
time the war had not closed, and French Pembroke
and his brother came to Paris that the surgeons
might work upon poor Miles. They could not but
meet often at the Berkeleys, and Pembroke, it must
be admitted, was not devoid of admiration for the
handsome Madame Koller, who had the divine
voice&mdash;when she could be persuaded to sing, which
was not often. He had been rather attentive to
her, much to Ahlberg’s disgust. And to Ahlberg’s
infinite rage, Madame Koller fell distinctly and
unmistakably in love with Pembroke. If Ahlberg
had only known the truth, Pembroke was
really the first gentleman that poor Madame Koller
had ever known intimately since her childhood in
Virginia. Certainly the wildest stretch of imagination
could not call the late Koller a gentleman, and
even Ahlberg himself, although a member of the
diplomatic corps, hardly came under that description.</p>

<p>Pembroke had a kind of hazy idea that widows
could take care of themselves. Besides, he was
not really in love with her&mdash;only a little dazzled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
by her voice and her yellow hair. His wrath may
be imagined when after a considerable wrench in
tearing himself away from Paris, and when he had
begun to regard Olivia Berkeley with that lofty
approval which sometimes precedes love making,
to return to Virginia, and in six weeks to find Madame
Schmidt and Madame Koller established at
their old place, The Beeches, and Ahlberg, who
had been their shadow for two years, living at the
village tavern. He felt that this following him, on
the part of Madame Koller, made him ridiculous.
He was mortally afraid of being laughed at about
it. Instead of holding his own stoutly in acrid discussions
with Colonel Berkeley, Pembroke began
to be afraid of the old gentleman’s pointed allusions
to the widow. He even got angry with poor little
Miles when the boy ventured upon a little sly chaff.
As for Olivia Berkeley, she took Madame Koller’s
conduct in coming to Virginia in high dudgeon,
with that charming inconsequence of noble and
inexperienced women. What particular offense it
gave her, beyond the appearance of following Pembroke,
which was shocking to her good taste, she
could not have explained to have saved her life.
But with Madame Koller she took a tone of politeness,
sweet yet chilly, like frozen cream&mdash;and the
same in a less degree, toward Pembroke. She
seemed to say, “Odious and underbred as this thing
is, I, you see, can afford to be magnanimous.”
Colonel Berkeley chuckled at this on the part of
his daughter, as he habitually did at the innocent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
foibles of his fellow creatures. It was very innocent,
very feminine, and very exasperating.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, within a week the big landau was
drawn up, and Colonel Berkeley and his daughter
set forth, <i>en grand tenue</i>, with Petrarch on the box,
to call on Madame Koller. The Colonel had never
ceased teasing his daughter to go. Time hung
heavy on his hands, and although he had not found
Madame Koller particularly captivating elsewhere,
and Madame Schmidt bored him to death upon the
few occasions when she appeared, yet, when he
was at Isleham, the ladies at The Beeches assumed
quite a fascinating aspect to his imagination. The
Colonel had a private notion of his own that Madame
Koller had been a little too free with her
income, and that a year’s retirement would contribute
to the health of her finances. Olivia, however,
believed that Madame Koller had but one
object in returning to America, and that was
because Pembroke had come. She remembered
one evening in Paris, Pembroke had “dropped in,”
American fashion. The doctors had then said that
nothing could be done to restore poor Miles to
comeliness&mdash;and meanwhile, another blow had
fallen upon the two brothers. Their only sister,
Elizabeth, a handsome, high spirited girl, older than
they, had died&mdash;and there had been a violent breach
between her and their father to which death alone
put a truce. When the country was overrun with
troops, a Federal officer had protected the plantation
as far as he could, had saved the old father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
from the consequences of his own rash conduct, and
had taken a deep and tender interest in the daughter.
This was enough to blast Elizabeth’s life.
She gave up her lover&mdash;silently, but with a strange
unyielding gentleness, she kept aloof from her
father. She was not condemned to suffer long.
The unhappy father followed her swiftly to the old
burying ground at Malvern. Men commonly seek
distraction in griefs. Pembroke was like the rest.
He was popular, especially among the English
colony where his love of sports and manly accomplishments
made him a favorite&mdash;to say nothing
of that prestige, which attaches to a man who has
seen service. He had gone into the war a lieutenant,
and had come out as major of his ragged,
half-starved regiment. Therefore when Pembroke
idled and amused himself in Paris, for some time
Olivia could only feel sympathy for him. She knew
well enough that his means were small and the
company he kept was liable to diminish them&mdash;but
after a while, she began to feel a hot indignation
against him. So on this particular evening, the
Colonel falling asleep opportunely, she took occasion
to express her opinion to Pembroke, that their
ruined country needed the presence and the service
of every man she could call her own. Pembroke
defended himself warmly at first. He came for
Miles’ sake&mdash;the boy whom he had thought safe at
school, and who ran away in the very last days of
the war to enlist&mdash;and almost the last shot that was
fired&mdash;so Pembroke said bitterly&mdash;disfigured the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
boy as he now was. Miles had been eager to come,
although Pembroke was convinced from the beginning
that neither the French, nor any other surgeons
could repair the work of that shot. He
admitted that the boy had borne the final decision
with great manliness and courage “for such a little
chap,” the elder brother said fondly. When pressed
hard by Olivia about returning home, Pembroke
though had no resource but epigrams.</p>

<p>“At all events,” she said presently, with a pretty
air of heroism, “Papa and I are going home just as
soon as papa can do without his crutch. Papa is a patriot,
although he does talk so remarkably sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Then, after you have got back, you can let me
know how you like Virginia as it is, and perhaps I
will follow,” he answered, laughing in a very exasperating
way, Olivia thought. But when the
Berkeleys got home they found that the Pembrokes
had arrived some weeks before them&mdash;and soon
afterward Madame Koller and her mother turned up
quite unexpectedly at their deserted old place, only
to be followed shortly after by Ahlberg, who, from
his abode at the village tavern rode over every day
on a sorry nag, to see Madame Koller.</p>

<p>Imagine all this in a provincial country neighborhood!</p>

<p>Mr. Cole, the clergyman of Petsworth parish, was
a bachelor, a small, neatly-featured person, suspected
of High Church leanings. The Colonel had
bluntly inquired of him if he intended to call on
Madame Koller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“Hardly, I think, sir,” responded Mr. Cole, with
much severity. “She has not once been to church
since she returned to the county&mdash;and she only
two miles off&mdash;and I hear that she and her friend
Mr. Ahlberg play billiards all day long Sunday,
when they are not playing cards.”</p>

<p>“Only the more reason for you to convert the
heathen, ha! ha!” answered the Colonel&mdash;“and
let me tell you, Cole, if you hadn’t been a clergyman,
you would have been a regular slayer among
the women&mdash;and the heathen in this case is about
as pretty a heathen as you can find in the State of
Virginia, sir.”</p>

<p>Evidently these remarks made a great impression
on Mr. Cole, for on the sunny afternoon, when
Colonel Berkeley and Olivia drove up to the door
of The Beeches, they saw a clerical looking figure
disappear ahead of them within the doorway.</p>

<p>“The parson’s here, by Jove,” chuckled the
Colonel.</p>

<p>The house was modern and rather showy. Inside
there were evidences that Madame Koller was not
devoid of taste or money either. The Berkeleys
were ushered into a big square drawing-room, where,
seated in a high-backed chair, with his feet barely
touching the floor, was the little clergyman.</p>

<p>“Why, Cole, I am deuced glad you took my
advice,” cried the Colonel, advancing with outstretched
hand and with a kind of hearty good fellowship
that pleased Mr. Cole, and yet frightened
him a little. He was a good soul and divided his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
small salary with his mother, but he thought Colonel
Berkeley’s society rather dangerous for a clergyman.
He used too many expletives, and was altogether
too free in his notions of what a churchman
should be&mdash;for the Colonel was a stanch churchman,
and would have sworn like a pirate at anybody
who questioned his orthodoxy.</p>

<p>“Doing missionary work, hay, Mr. Cole?” continued
Colonel Berkeley, while Olivia and Mr. Cole
shook hands.</p>

<p>A faint pink mounted into the clergyman’s face.
His curiosity had got the better of him, but the
excellent little man fancied it was his Christian
charity that won the victory.</p>

<p>“Well, Colonel,” he begun, “upon reflection I
concluded it was my duty to call on Madame Koller.
I wasn’t in this parish&mdash;in fact, I wasn’t
ordained at the time Madame Koller was Miss Eliza
Peyton, and Madame Schmidt was Mrs. Edward
Peyton. And being the niece of my excellent
friend&mdash;Mrs. Sally Peyton&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Excellent friend, eh&mdash;well, don’t you trust Sally
Peyton too far, my good fellow. She was a mighty
uncertain kind of a friend thirty or forty years ago&mdash;not
that I have any particular reason for saying
so. But you are quite right in paying your
respects to Eliza Peyton&mdash;I mean Madame Koller,
and I only hope she’ll find our society agreeable
enough to stay here.”</p>

<p>A considerable wait ensued. Olivia had begun
to wonder how long it took Madame Koller to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
make a complete toilet, when a white hand
moved the curtain from a doorway, and noiselessly
and gently Madame Koller entered.</p>

<p>She was heartily glad to see them&mdash;their call was
not very prompt, but it would have been a cruel
mortification had they omitted to come. Olivia’s
hand she pressed&mdash;so she did the Colonel’s&mdash;and
also Mr. Cole’s, who colored quite violently, although
he struggled for self-possession.</p>

<p>“We are very glad you have come,” said Olivia,
with her sweetest affability, “you will be a great
acquisition to the neighborhood. You see, I am
already beginning to think more of our own neighborhood
than all the rest of the universe.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your kindness,” answered
Madame Koller, with equal cordiality. The two
women, however, did not cease to examine each
other like gladiators.</p>

<p>“And Mr. Cole, I think you were not here when
I lived at The Beeches as a girl.”</p>

<p>“No, madam,” replied Mr. Cole, who had now
shaded from a red to a pink.</p>

<p>“And did I not have the pleasure of seeing you
at the Campdown races the other day?”</p>

<p>Mr. Cole turned pale and nearly dropped off his
chair. The Colonel roared out his pleasant cheery
laugh.</p>

<p>“No madam, you did not.” Mr. Cole made his
denial so emphatic that he was ashamed of himself
for it afterwards.</p>

<p>“But you, Miss Berkeley, were there. My cousin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Ahlberg saw you. He praised you. He complimented
you. ‘I have often seen that face,’ he said.
‘There are some faces which one remembers even
in the whirl of the greatest cities. I drive around
the Bois de Boulogne&mdash;once&mdash;twice&mdash;three times.
I speak to a hundred friends. I see a thousand
faces. They pass before me like shadows of the
night. One face strikes me. It rises like a star
from out the sea. Ah, I exclaim, ‘here is another
photograph for my mental portrait gallery.’”</p>

<p>Neither the Colonel nor Olivia was fully prepared
to accept Ahlberg. Consequently, Madame Koller’s
remark was received with a cool smile by
Olivia&mdash;and a sniff by the Colonel. But Mr. Cole
was quite carried away by Madame Koller’s declamatory
manner, and her really beautiful voice.</p>

<p>“What a gift of tongues,” he said. “Madame
Koller, if a&mdash;er&mdash;public speaker&mdash;a religious instructor
had your felicity of expression&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I trust,” answered Madame, “some time to
have the pleasure of hearing <i>your</i> felicity of expression.
I am not what you call a Christian. I believe
in a system of ultimate good&mdash;a philosophy if you
will&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” cordially chimed in Colonel Berkeley
with something dangerously like a wink, “I knew
Madame, as soon as I saw you that you believed in a
system. It’s very useful and elastic and philosophic.”</p>

<p>Madame playfully waved her hand at the colonel,
and turned to Mr. Cole.</p>

<p>“We will be friends, nevertheless,” she said with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
a captivating smile. “I will visit your church in
the morning, and you will return to luncheon with
me, and we will have a little game of billiards afterward.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cole’s delicate face grew ashy. He, John
Chrysostom Cole, playing billiards on Sunday!
What would his mother say&mdash;and what would the
bishop say! Olivia looked a little shocked because
of course Madame Koller must know better. Not
so the Colonel. He laughed heartlessly at Mr. Cole,
and began to think Eliza Peyton was a more amusing
person than he had fancied.</p>

<p>“Madame Koller,” began Mr. Cole solemnly after
a moment, “your long absence from this country&mdash;your
unfamiliarity with clergymen perhaps&mdash;and
with the American Sabbath&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I remember the American Sabbath
very well,” replied Madame Koller laughing and
raising her eyebrows. “My aunt, Mrs. Peyton,
always took me to church with her, and I had to
listen to Dr. Steptoe’s sermons. Oh those sermons!
However,” she added, turning her expressive
eyes full on Mr. Cole. “I know, I <i>know</i> yours
must be very different. Well, I will go. And forgive
me, if I sometimes shock you&mdash;forgive and
pity me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cole thought that only a heart of stone
could have hardened against that pretty appeal.
And the widow was so deliciously charming with
her half-foreign manner and her whole-foreign look.
But billiards on Sunday!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“Extend the invitation to me, ma’am,” said the
Colonel. “I go to church on Sunday&mdash;I have no
system, just the plain religious belief of a churchman
and a gentleman&mdash;my ancestors were not
a lot of psalm-singing hypocrites, but cavaliers,
madam, from the Court of Charles the Second.
But after I’ve been to church to please my conscience
and my daughter, I don’t mind pleasing
myself a little. I’ll play billiards with you&mdash;”</p>

<p>The door opened and Ahlberg appeared. Now
Mr. Ahlberg was not a favorite of Colonel Berkeley’s
at any time&mdash;still less of Olivia’s; but it was in
the country, and it was very, very dull, so he got
the most cordial greeting he had ever had from
either of them. The conversation became general,
and as soon as Ahlberg had the opportunity, he
edged toward Olivia. He was no gentle, unsophisticated
creature, like Mr. Cole. He knew that
Olivia Berkeley’s polite and self-possessed manner
toward him concealed a certain hardness. He
made no particular headway in her good graces he
saw&mdash;and not much more in the Colonel’s. But
both gentlemen were hard up for amusement, and
each was willing to be amused, so, when Mr. Ahlberg,
after a few well-bred vacuities with Olivia, devoted
himself to Colonel Berkeley, he was rewarded with
the intimation that the Colonel would call on
him at the village tavern, and this was followed
up by another hint of a dinner invitation to follow.
This cheered Mr. Ahlberg very much, for to tell
the truth he was as near starvation as a man could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
be in this nineteenth century, who had money in
his pocket. If, however, Mr. Ahlberg had made
it his business to horrify Mr. Cole, he could not
have done it more thoroughly. He bewailed the
absence of book-makers at the races, and wished to
know why elections were not held in America on
Sunday, took occasion to say that religion was
merely an affair of the State, and he too was a
believer in a system. When they all rose to go,
poor Mr. Cole was quite limp and overcome, but he
made an effort to retain his self-possession. He
urged both Madame Koller and Mr. Ahlberg to
attend the morning service on the following Sunday.
Both promised conditionally.</p>

<p>The clergyman had walked over from the rectory
where his mother presided over his modest
establishment.</p>

<p>“Come, Cole,” cried the Colonel, who was the
soul of hospitality, “here’s another seat in the
carriage. Come back to dinner with us. I’ve got
some capital champagne, and Olivia will play for
you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care about the champagne, thank you,”
answered Mr. Cole, “but I’ll come for the pleasure
of Miss Olivia’s playing and her society also.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had the carriage turned into the lane,
when Mr. Cole burst forth:</p>

<p>“Miss Olivia, did you ever meet a more godless
person in your life than Mr. Ahlberg?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ever did,” answered Olivia,
with much sincerity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“But the widow&mdash;Eliza Peyton&mdash;eh, Cole? I
think you have made some headway there,” cried
the Colonel, wagging his head at the little clergyman.
Mr. Cole’s heart began to thump. Strange
it was that although he ought, as a Christian and a
clergyman, to disapprove of Madame Koller with
her beautiful blonde hair, he could not find it in his
heart to feel it. Nevertheless he could say it
easily enough.</p>

<p>“I very much doubt, sir, the propriety of my
visiting at The Beeches.”</p>

<p>“Pooh, pooh. You’ll get over it,” chuckled
Colonel Berkeley.</p>

<p>Ah, John Chrysostom! Has it never been known
that the outward man denounced what the inward
man yearned and hankered after? At this very
moment do you not remember the turn of Madame
Koller’s handsome head, and the faint perfume that
exhaled from her trailing gown?</p>

<p>“We must invite them to dinner,” said the
Colonel, decidedly. “Cole, you must come, too.
That poor devil, Ahlberg, is almost starved at the
tavern on fried chicken three times a day, and
claret from the tavern bar.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A round</span> of solemn afternoon dinings followed
the return of the Berkeleys to Isleham, and were
scrupulously returned. But both the Colonel and
Olivia felt that it would not be well to include any
of the county gentry the day Madame Koller and
Mr. Ahlberg were to dine with them. Mr. Cole
had already been invited&mdash;and Colonel Berkeley of
his own free will, without saying a word to Olivia,
asked the two Pembrokes. Olivia, when she heard
of this, was intensely vexed. She had used both
sarcasm and persuasion on Pembroke in Paris to
get him home, and he had laughed at her. Yet she
was firmly convinced, as soon as Madame Koller
expressed a determination to come, either Pembroke
had agreed, or else Madame Koller had followed
him&mdash;in either case Olivia was not pleased,
and received the Colonel’s information that the
Pembrokes would be there sure in ominous silence.
Nothing remained but for her to show what a
remarkably good dinner she could give&mdash;and this
she felt was clearly within her power. She was
naturally a clever housekeeper, and as the case often
was in those days, the freedom of the negroes had
made but little difference in the ménage at Isleham.
Most of the house servants had turned
squatters on the plantation. Petrarch, unpopular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
among his confrères because of his superior advantages
and accomplishments as well as his assumption
of righteousness, was the major-domo&mdash;and
then there was Ike, a gingerbread colored Chesterfield,
as dining-room servant.</p>

<p>“Miss ’Livy, you jes’ let me manage dem black
niggers,” was Petrarch’s sensible advice. “Dey
doan know nuttin’ ’bout a real swell dinner. I say
yistiddy to Cook M’ria, ‘Why doan yer have
some orntrees fur dinner outen all dat chicken an’
truck you has lef’ over ev’y day?’ an’ Miss ’Livy, ef
you will b’lieve me, dat nigger, she chase me outen
de kitchen wid a shovel full o’ live coals. She ain’
got no ’spect for ’ligion. Arter I got out in de
yard, I say, ‘You discontemptuous, disreligious ole
cantamount, doan’ you know better’n to sass de
Lord’s ’n’inted?’” (this being Petrarch’s favorite
characterization of himself). “But M’ria ain’ got
de sperrit ’scusin’ ’tis de sperrit o’ owdaciousness.
Ez fur dat Ike, I done tole him ‘I am de Gord o’
respicution,’ an’ he ’low I ain’t no sech a thing. I
gwi’n lick dat yaller nigger fo’ long.”</p>

<p>“You’d better not try it Uncle Petrarch&mdash;” (Petrarch
was near to sixty, and was therefore by courtesy,
Uncle Petrarch). “Ike won’t stand it, and
<i>I</i> won’t have it either, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>The Berkeleys went against the county custom,
and dined in the evening. Therefore, at seven
o’clock precisely, on the evening of the dinner,
French Pembroke and his brother entered the
quaint old drawing-room at Isleham. Olivia had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
learned the possibilities of ancient mahogany furniture
and family portraits, and the great rambling
old house was picturesque enough. A genuine
Virginia wood fire roared up the chimney, where
most of the heat as well as the flame went. Wax
candles, in tall silver candlesticks, were on the mantel,
and the piano. Miss Berkeley herself, in a white
wool gown, looked a part of the pleasant home-like
picture, as she greeted her two guests. French
Pembroke had called twice to see them, but neither
time had Olivia been at home. This, then, was
their first meeting, except the few minutes at the
races. He was the same easy, pleasantly cynical
Pembroke she had known in Paris. There was
another French Pembroke whom she remembered
in her childish days as very good natured, when he
was not very tyrannical, in the visits she used to
pay with her dead and gone mother long ago to
Malvern&mdash;and this other Pembroke could recite
wonderful poetry out of books, and scare little
Miles and herself into delicious spasms of terror
by the weird stories he would tell. But Miles had
changed in every way. He had been in his earlier
boyish days the pet and darling of women, but now
he slunk away from the pity in their tender eyes.
He had once had a mannish little strut and a way
of looking out of his bold blue eyes that made a
path for him wherever he chose to tread. But
now he shambled in, keeping as far out of sight as
possible behind the elder brother’s stalwart figure.</p>

<p>Colonel Berkeley shook Miles’s one hand cordially.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
His armless sleeve was pinned up to his
coat front.</p>

<p>“God bless my soul,” the Colonel cried. “Am
I getting old? Here’s little Miles Pembroke almost
a man.”</p>

<p>“Almost&mdash;papa&mdash;you mean quite a man. It is
a dreadful reflection to me that I am older than
Miles,” said Olivia, smiling. Then they sat about
the fire, and Olivia, putting her fan down in her
lap, looked French Pembroke full in the face and
said, “You know, perhaps, that Madame Koller
and Mr. Ahlberg dine here to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Pembroke, with all the coolness
of conscious innocence&mdash;or brazen assurance of
careless wickedness, Olivia could not tell which.</p>

<p>“You saw a good deal of them abroad, didn’t
you?” was her next question.</p>

<p>“Yes,” again replied Pembroke.</p>

<p>“Olivia, my dear,” said her father, who very
much enjoyed this little episode, “you women
will never learn that you can’t find anything out
by asking questions; and Pembroke, my boy,
remember that women never believe you except
when you are lying to them. Let him alone,
Olivia, and he will tell you the whole story, I’ll
warrant.”</p>

<p>Olivia’s training had made her something of a
stoic under Colonel Berkeley’s remarks, but at this
a deep red dyed her clear pale face. She was the
best of daughters, but she could at that moment
have cheerfully inflicted condign punishment on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
her father. Pembroke saw it too, not without a little
malicious satisfaction. She had quietly assumed
in her tone and manner that he was in some way
responsible for Madame Koller and her mother being
at The Beeches&mdash;an incident fraught with much
discomfort for him&mdash;none the less that there was
nothing tragic about it, but rather ridiculous. All
the same, he determined to set himself right on the
spot.</p>

<p>“Of course, I saw them often. It would have
been quite unpardonable if I had not, considering
we were often in the same places&mdash;and our land
joins. I can’t say that I recollect Madame Koller
very much before she went away. I only remember
her as rather an ugly little thing, always strumming
on the piano. I took the liberty of telling
both her and Madame Schmidt that I did not think
they would find a winter at The Beeches very pleasant&mdash;but
it seems she did not agree with me.
Ahlberg is a cousin by marriage, and has been in
the diplomatic corps&mdash;”</p>

<p>And at that very moment Petrarch threw open
the drawing-room door and announced “Mrs. Koller
and Mr. Ahlberg, sah.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller’s appearance was none the less
striking in evening dress, with ropes of amber
around her neck, and some very fine diamonds.
Who says that women are indifferent to each other?
The instant Olivia beheld Madame Koller in her
gorgeous trailing gown of yellow silk, and her jewels,
she felt plain, insignificant, and colorless both in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
features, dress and manner&mdash;while Madame Koller,
albeit she knew both herself and other women singularly
well, almost envied Olivia the girlish simplicity,
the slightness and grace that made her a
pretty picture in her white gown with the bunch of
late autumn roses at her belt.</p>

<p>The clergyman came last. Then Petrarch opened
the folding doors and announced dinner, and Colonel
Berkeley gallantly offering his arm to Madame Koller,
they all marched in.</p>

<p>Something like a sigh of satisfaction escaped Mr.
Ahlberg. Once more he was to dine. Madame
Koller sat on the Colonel’s right, and at her right was
Mr. Cole. The clergyman’s innocent heart beat
when he saw this arrangement. He still fancied
that he strongly disapproved of Madame Koller,
the more so when he saw the nonchalant way in
which she took champagne and utterly ignored the
carafe of water at her plate. Mr. Cole took only
claret, and watered that liberally.</p>

<p>Madame Koller certainly had a very pretty manner&mdash;rather
elaborate and altogether different from
Olivia’s self-possessed simplicity. She spoke of her
mother&mdash;“so happy once more to be back in Virginia.”
Madame Schmidt, always wrapped up in
shawls, and who never volunteered a remark to anybody
in her life, scarcely seemed to outsiders to be
quite capable of any enjoyment. And Aunt Peyton&mdash;dear
Aunt Peyton&mdash;so kind, so handsome&mdash;so
anxious that people shall please themselves&mdash;“Upon
my soul, madam,” cried the Colonel, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
much hearty good humor, “I am delighted to hear
that last about my old friend Sally Peyton. I’ve
known her well for fifty years&mdash;perhaps she wouldn’t
acknowledge it&mdash;and a more headstrong, determined,
self-willed woman I never saw. Sally is a
good woman, and by heaven, she was a devilish
pretty one when&mdash;when&mdash;you may have heard the
story, ma’am&mdash;but she always wanted to please herself
a d&mdash;n sight more than anybody else&mdash;including
Ned Peyton.”</p>

<p>The Colonel said this quite pleasantly, and
Madame Koller smiled at it&mdash;she seldom laughed.
“Were you not some years in the army, Colonel
Berkeley?” she asked presently. “It seems to
me I have some recollection of having heard it.”
Colonel Berkeley colored slightly. He valued his
military title highly, but he didn’t know exactly
how he came by it.</p>

<p>“The fact is madam,” he replied, clearing his
throat, “in the old days we had a splendid militia.
Don’t you remember the general musters, hay?
Now I was the&mdash;the commanding officer of the
Virginia Invincibles&mdash;a crack cavalry company,
composed exclusively of the county gentlemen&mdash;and
in some way, they called me colonel, and a
colonel I remained.”</p>

<p>“The title seems quite natural,” said Madame
Koller, with a sweet smile&mdash;“You have such a
military carriage&mdash;that indescribable air&mdash;” at which
the Colonel, who never tired of laughing at other
people’s foibles, straightened up, assumed a martial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
pose, and showed vast elation and immense
pleasure&mdash;which Madame Koller saw out of the
corner of her eye.</p>

<p>Miles, sitting next Olivia, had grown confidential.
“I&mdash;I&mdash;want to tell you,” he said bashfully,
“the reason why I didn’t come to see you in Paris.
It required some nerve for a fellow&mdash;in my condition&mdash;to
face a woman&mdash;even the best and kindest.”</p>

<p>“Was that it?” answered Olivia half smiling.</p>

<p>“You are laughing at me,” he said reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Of course I am,” replied Olivia.</p>

<p>A genuine look of relief stole into his poor face.
Perhaps it was not so bad after all if Olivia Berkeley
could laugh at his sensitiveness.</p>

<p>“So,” continued Olivia, promptly, “you acted
like a vain, foolish boy. But I see you are getting
over it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try. You wouldn’t treat me so cavalierly,
would you, if&mdash;if&mdash;it were quite&mdash;dreadful?”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t dreadful at all, or anything like it,”
replied Olivia, telling one of those generous and
womanly fibs that all true women utter with the
full approval of their consciences.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ahlberg and Pembroke had been
conversing. Ahlberg was indeed a clever fellow&mdash;for
he talked in a straightforward way, and gave
not the slightest ground in anything he said for
the suspicion that Pembroke obstinately cherished
against him.</p>

<p>“What do you do with yourself all day, Miss
Berkeley?” asked Pembroke after a while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“There is plenty to do. I have a dozen servants
to manage that ran wild while we were away&mdash;and
the house to keep, and to look after the garden&mdash;and
I ride or drive every day&mdash;and keep up
my piano playing&mdash;and read a little. What do
you do?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Pembroke, boldly.</p>

<p>Olivia did not say a word. She threw him one
brief glance though, from her dark eyes that conveyed
a volume.</p>

<p>“I have a license to practice law,” he continued,
coolly. “I’ve had it for five years&mdash;got it just
before the State went out, when I went out too.
Four years’ soldiering isn’t a good preparation for
the law.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Olivia.</p>

<p>“I have enough left, I daresay, to keep me without
work,” he added.</p>

<p>If he had studied how to make himself contemptible
in Olivia’s eyes, he could not have done so
more completely. She had acquired perfect self-possession
of manner, but her mobile face was as
yet undisciplined. When to this last remark she
said in her sweetest manner, “Won’t you let
Petrarch fill your glass?” it was equivalent to saying,
“You are the most worthless and contemptible
creature on this planet.” Just then the Colonel’s
cheery voice resounded from the foot of the table.</p>

<p>“Pembroke, when I drove through the Court
House to-day, it made me feel like a young man
again, to see your father’s old tin sign hanging out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
of the old office, ‘French Pembroke, Attorney at
Law.’ It has been a good many years since that
sign was first put up. Egad, your father and I have
had some good times in that office, in the old, old
days. He always kept a first-class brand of liquors.
His style of serving it wasn’t very imposing, but it
didn’t hurt the liquor. I’ve drank cognac fit for a
king in that office, and drank it out of a shaving
mug borrowed from the barber next door&mdash;ha! ha!”</p>

<p>A change like magic swept over Olivia’s face. It
indicated great relief that Pembroke was not an
idle scamp after all. She tried to look sternly and
reproachfully at him, but a smile lurked in her eyes.</p>

<p>“You are not as lazy as I thought you, but twice
as deceitful,” she said.</p>

<p>Pembroke was amused at the extreme suavity of
the two ladies toward each other, knowing that
at heart it masked an armed neutrality. Particularly
did he notice it after dinner, when they
returned to the drawing-room and the piano was
opened. Madame Koller was asked to sing, but first
begged that Miss Berkeley should play. Olivia, without
protesting, went to the piano. Her playing was
finished and artistic, and full of the delicate repose
of a true musician. When she rose Madame Koller
overflowed with compliments. “And now, madam,”
said the Colonel, rising and offering his hand with a
splendid and graceful flourish, “will you not let us
hear that voice that charmed us when you were little
Eliza Peyton.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller did not like to be called Eliza<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Peyton&mdash;it was too commonplace&mdash;Elise Koller
was much more striking. And then she was uncertain
whether to sing or not. She had tried hard to
keep that stage episode secret, and she was afraid
if she sang, that something might betray her. She
glanced at Ahlberg, as much as to say, “Shall I?”
but Ahlberg maintained a sphinx-like gravity. But
the temptation was too great. Olivia’s playing
was pretty for an amateur&mdash;but Madame Koller despised
the best amateur performance as only a true
professional can. Therefore she rose and went to
the piano, and turned over some of the ballads
there. She pretended to be looking at them, but
she was not.</p>

<p>“Louis,” she said to Ahlberg, who was twisting
his waxed mustache. He came at once and
seated himself at the piano.</p>

<p>“What do you think of ‘<i>Caro nome?</i>’” she asked.</p>

<p>“Very good. You always sung the <i>Rigoletto</i>
music well.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller was not pleased at this slip&mdash;but
at all events, nobody but herself understood it in
the sense that Ahlberg meant.</p>

<p>Ahlberg struck a few chords, and Madame Koller
begun from memory the celebrated aria. As she
sang, Colonel Berkeley opened his sharp old eyes very
wide indeed. This was not the kind of music often
heard in drawing-rooms. He glanced at Pembroke,
to see if he was astonished. That young gentleman
only leaned back in the sofa corner near the
fire to better enjoy this delicious singing. Olivia’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
face looked puzzled&mdash;so did Miles. In singing,
Madame Koller was handsomer than ever. She
had perfect control over her facial expression, and
seemed quite transformed. Once or twice she used
a graceful gesture, or made a step forward&mdash;it was
highly dramatic, but not in the least stagy.</p>

<p>But if Madame Koller’s performance was far out
of the common run, so was that of her accompanist.
He looked remarkably at home on the piano stool,
and Colonel Berkeley rubbed his eyes and tried to
recall if he had ever seen Ahlberg ornamenting a
piano stool at a concert, but could not remember.
When the last brilliant note and rich chord died
away Miles Pembroke suddenly began to clap his
knee loudly with his one remaining hand&mdash;which
produced a furious hand clapping, in which everybody
else vehemently and involuntarily joined, Mr.
Cole feebly shouting “Bravo! Bravo!” Madame
Koller started, and when the applause ceased, she
seemed like one coming out of a dream. In the
buzz of compliments that followed, Ahlberg’s voice
cut in saying, “You were too dramatic.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller had been receiving the compliments
paid her with smiling grace, but at this, she
cast a strange look on Ahlberg, nor would she sing
again, although urged to do so. And presently it
was time to leave, and Madame Koller and her
escort departed in the little victoria which had
come for them, the Colonel wrapping her up in
innumerable furs to protect her from the sharp
night air of November.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>When he returned to the drawing-room, Olivia
and the clergyman and the Pembrokes were all
standing around the blazing fire. The Colonel
walked in, and squaring himself before the generous
fireplace with his coat tails over his arm, surveyed
the company and remarked,</p>

<p>“Professional, by Jove.”</p>

<p>“Now, papa,” said Olivia, taking him by the arm,
“you are the best and kindest of men, but you
shan’t say ‘professional, by Jove,’ of Madame
Koller, the very minute she has quitted your house.
You know how often I’ve told you of my rule that
you shall not mention the name of a guest until
twenty-four hours after that guest’s departure.”</p>

<p>She said it with an air of authority, and tweaked
the Colonel’s ear to emphasize her severity.</p>

<p>“But I am not saying any harm about her,
Olivia.”</p>

<p>“Just what I expected,” groaned Mr. Cole.</p>

<p>“Perhaps her voice gave out, and she quitted the
stage early,” remarked Pembroke.</p>

<p>“Not a word more,” cried Olivia sternly. “She
sings delightfully. But&mdash;a&mdash;it <i>was</i> rather prima
donna-ish.”</p>

<p>“Aha! Oho!” shouted the Colonel. “There
you are, my dear!”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A week</span> or two after the dinner at Isleham, Pembroke
sat in his office, one afternoon, at the county-seat,
with a letter spread out before him. It was
very thumbed and illiterate, and quite devoid of
punctuation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“bob henry.”</p></div>

<p>This letter had reached him in Paris, and had
more to do with bringing him home just when he
came than Madame Koller&mdash;much more than Madame
Koller expected&mdash;or Olivia, either, for that
matter.</p>

<p>“It is a rather hard case,” he thought to himself,
with a grim smile, “a man can’t go and say, ‘See
what a disinterested thing I have done: come
home months before I intended, to defend a poor
ragged black rascal that claimed to be my “vally,”
and expects to be hanged&mdash;and half the county
believes I came in obedience to Madame Koller.’”
But it occurred to him that he had done a good deal
to make both Olivia Berkeley and Madame Koller
believe what was not true about his return.</p>

<p>He put on his hat and, putting the letter in his
pocket, went out and mounted his horse and rode
off at a smart canter away from the village, down a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
little-used road, until he came to a stretch of pine
woods. Then, following a bridle path a mile or
more, he came upon a log house.</p>

<p>Everything had an air of sylvan peace in the
quiet autumn afternoon. There was nothing to
indicate domestic life about the place&mdash;the persons
who lived within had no garden, no fowls&mdash;nothing
but the log cabin under the pines. Pembroke
knocked loudly with the butt of his riding whip at
the rude door, but a voice a little way off answered
him.</p>

<p>“Don’t waste your strength on the portcullis of
the castle. Here I am.”</p>

<p>Pembroke followed the sound, leading his horse,
and in a minute or two came upon a man of middle
age, lying full length on the soft bed of pine
needles, with a book and a pipe.</p>

<p>“This is peaceful,” said Pembroke, after tethering
his horse and seating himself. “At Malvern it
is more lonely than peaceful. The house is so
large and so empty&mdash;Miles and I live in one wing
of it. It wasn’t half a bad thing for you, Cave,
when the doctors ordered you to the pine woods.”</p>

<p>Cave nodded.</p>

<p>“It’s uncommonly quiet and peaceful, this camping
out. As I have no other house to go to, since
mine was burned down, it rather bridges over the
gulf of appearances to say I am living in a log
cabin by command of the most mighty Dr. Sam
Jones.”</p>

<p>“And there is no loneliness like that of a half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
deserted house,” continued Pembroke, unconsciously
dropping his voice in sympathy with the
faint woodland murmur around them. “It seems
to me at Malvern that I continually hear my
mother’s voice, and my father’s footstep, and all
the pleasant family commotion I remember. And
Elizabeth&mdash;Cave, no woman I ever knew suffered
like my sister&mdash;and she was not the woman to
suffer patiently. Old Keturah tells me that my
father would have yielded at any time after he
saw that her heart and life were bound up in
Waring&mdash;but she would not ask him&mdash;so while I
was enjoying myself three thousand miles away,
and only sad when I came home to Miles, Elizabeth
and my father were fighting that dreary battle.
Keturah says that everybody said she was sweetly
and gently patient, but all night she would walk
the floor sobbing and weeping, while my father
below walked his floor. It killed them both.”</p>

<p>Cave had turned away his head. Who has
watched one, dearly loved, waste and die for
another, without knowing all there is of bitterness?
And was Pembroke so forgetful? He was not,
indeed&mdash;but he had begun telling of the things
which troubled him, and because he could bear to
speak of poor Elizabeth he thought that Cave
could bear to hear it. But there was a pause&mdash;a
pause in which Pembroke suddenly felt ashamed
and heartless. Elizabeth’s death was much to him&mdash;but
it was everything to Cave. So Pembroke continued,
rather to excuse himself, “Your cabin in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
the woods is at least not haunted by the dead people
you loved. Sometimes, when I go into my
mother’s room and see everything as she left it&mdash;the
mirror in which I have often seen her braid her
hair&mdash;she had scarcely a gray lock in it when she
died&mdash;I feel&mdash;I cannot describe to you what I
feel.”</p>

<p>“You ought to marry,” remarked Cave, in a cold,
quiet voice.</p>

<p>“Not I,” answered Pembroke, carelessly, glad to
escape from the train he had himself started. “I
suppose a man ought to marry some time or other&mdash;but
forty is early enough. I wouldn’t mind
waiting until I were fifty. At sixty a man is apt to
make an infernal fool of himself.”</p>

<p>“How about Eliza Peyton&mdash;or Madame Koller&mdash;whom
you followed here?”</p>

<p>Pembroke had lighted a cigar since they began
talking, and had disposed of himself comfortably
on the pine needles by the side of his friend. The
silence was the unbroken silence of the autumn
woods. There was not the faintest whisper of
wind, but over their heads the solemn trees leaned
together and rustled softly. A long pause came
after Cave’s question. Into Pembroke’s sunburnt
face a dark flush slowly mounted. It is not often
that a man of his type, with his iron jaw and strong
features, blushes&mdash;but this was a blush of consciousness,
though not of shame.</p>

<p>“I did not follow her here,” he said. “But who
believes me? I think the woman herself fancies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
I did follow her. As for that little haughty Olivia
Berkeley, the girl gives me a look that is equivalent
to a box on the ear every time Madame Koller
is mentioned. If ever I marry, I shan’t take a
woman of spirit, you may depend upon it. I shall
take a placid, stout creature. An eaglet like Olivia
Berkeley is well enough for a man to amuse
himself with&mdash;but for steady matrimony give me a
barnyard fowl.”</p>

<p>“God help you,” answered Cave piously.</p>

<p>“But what really brought me here&mdash;although I
knew all the time that I ought not to be loitering
in Europe, and would probably have come anyhow&mdash;was
this poor devil, Bob Henry, in jail,
charged with murdering Hackett, that scalawag
the Hibbses brought here.”</p>

<p>At this Cave sat up, full of animation.</p>

<p>“I can help the poor fellow, I think,” he said.
“I went to see him as soon as they put him in jail&mdash;a
wretched looking object in rags he was, too.
He seemed to put great faith in you, and I did
not tell him of some evidence that I have got hold
of. The fellow’s going to get clear between us, I
think.”</p>

<p>Pembroke sat up too, and took the cigar out of
his mouth. The lawyer’s instinct rose within him,
and he took to his profession like a pointer to his
field work.</p>

<p>“You see, having been away during Hackett’s
time, I know nothing of his habits or associations
except from hearsay. Any lawyer in the county<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
could do better for poor Bob Henry than I&mdash;in that
way.”</p>

<p>“Hackett, you know, was a Northern man, who
came down here and bought property during the
war. He was a rabid Southerner. I distrusted the
man for that alone. He was related to our friends,
the Hibbses. I always suspected he had something
to do with that gang of deserters down by the
river, and if he was not a spy, then John Cave is a
fool.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;what else?”</p>

<p>“Of course you know about Bob Henry’s buying
the land of him, and the money he owed him, and
the fight. The negro, after Hackett had struck
him and insulted his wife, struck him back with a
stick. Now the Hibbses, and everybody else for
that matter, think that blow killed him. You see,
among the people Hackett had a kind of false
popularity, as a Northern man who has espoused
Southern sentiments&mdash;a hypocrite, in short. The
feeling against that poor black wretch was savage.”</p>

<p>“So,” said Pembroke, “instead of proving that
the blow did kill Hackett, the jury will want it
proved that it didn’t kill Hackett.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Hackett, I understand, was a convivial soul.
It can be proved that he mounted his horse, rode
home, and six hours afterward was walking about.
It never seemed to occur to these country doctors
to look for any other injury than the bruise on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
head, when they found him as good as dead next
morning. I hear, though, that people who passed
his house at night would often hear shouting and
carousing. Now, who did that shouting and carousing?
Not the gentlemen in the county, certainly,
nor anybody else that I can find out. This fits in
with your account of his associating with deserters.
I have always had a theory that he received an
injury that killed him between the time he was
seen alive and apparently well, and when he was
found dying in his bed.”</p>

<p>“That is precisely what I think&mdash;and I have
a witness, a ragged boy, hereabouts, whom I have
tried to keep respectable, who heard a great noise
as of men shouting and drinking at Hackett’s house
the night of Hackett’s death. The boy was cold
and hungry, and although he knew he would be
driven away if caught&mdash;for Hackett was a hard-hearted
villain&mdash;yet he sneaked up to the house
and gazed through the half-drawn curtains at the
men sitting around the table, fascinated as he says
by the sight of fire and food. He heard Hackett
singing and laughing, and he saw the faces, and&mdash;mark
you,&mdash;knows the names of those low fellows,
who have never been suspected, and who
have kept so remarkably quiet. Then, here is the
point&mdash;one of the very men who deserted from my
company, and was very thick afterward with Hackett,
suddenly disappeared, and within a month
died of injuries he could give no account of. You
may depend upon it they had a fight, and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
my former companion in arms that killed the
worthy Hackett&mdash;not poor Bob Henry’s blow.”</p>

<p>Pembroke’s dark eyes shone.</p>

<p>“We’ll keep this to ourselves, and make the
fellow hold his tongue. We won’t give the deserters
a chance to concoct a plausible lie. They will
be certain to be at the court house when the trial
comes off, and when I put them in the witness box
unprepared&mdash;you will see.”</p>

<p>They talked over the case a half an hour longer
before Pembroke got up to go. Then he said:
“Are you going to call at The Beeches? You
must have known Eliza Koller before she left
here.”</p>

<p>“Know her,” cried Cave, “yes, I know her. I
hope she has improved in every other way as much
as she has in looks. I saw her the other day. It
seemed to me that her hair was not so violently
yellow when she went away; however, I’ll be cautious,&mdash;I
see you are badly singed. Little Olivia
Berkeley wouldn’t do for my lord&mdash;”</p>

<p>Pembroke got up and flung off in a passion, pursued
by Cave shouting:</p>

<p>“I’ll give long odds on the widow!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> Sundays after that, Mr. Cole’s heart was
gladdened by the sight of Madame Koller and
the bundle of cloaks and mufflers she called her
mamma, walking in church just as the morning
service was beginning. The little clergyman felt
inspired. He fancied himself like Paul before the
Athenians. Olivia Berkeley was there too, and the
Colonel, who settled himself in his pew to catch
Mr. Cole in a false syllogism or a misquotation&mdash;anything
to chaff the reverend gentleman about during
the coming week. Mr. Cole did his best. He laid
aside his manuscript and indulged in an extempore
address that warmed the orator, if not the congregation,
with something like eloquence. The Hibbses
were there too&mdash;a florid, well-dressed family, Mr.
Hibbs making the responses in a basso so much
louder than Mr. Cole’s mild treble that it seemed
as if Mr. Hibbs were the parson and Mr. Cole the
clerk.</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is my dear,” Colonel Berkeley
had said angrily to his daughter half an hour before
when the Hibbses swept past them up the flagged
walk through the churchyard, “the religion of these
infernal Hibbs people is what disgusts me most.
They made their money in the war of 1812. Up
to then they were shouting Methodists&mdash;I’ve heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
my father swear it a hundred times&mdash;” The Colonel
belonged to a class, not uncommon in Virginia,
who regarded the Episcopal Church as a close corporation,
and resented with great pugnacity any
attempt to enter it on the part of the great unwashed.
It was the vehicle chosen by the first
families to go to heaven in, and marked “Reserved.”
Hence the Colonel’s wrath. His church
was a church founded by gentlemen, of gentlemen,
and for gentlemen, and it was a great liberty for
any other class to seek that aristocratic mode of
salvation.</p>

<p>“Now, damme, the Hibbses are the greatest
Episcopalians in the parish. I am as good a churchman
as there is in the county, but begad, if I want
such a set of vulgarians worshiping under the
same roof and rubbing elbows with me when I go
up to the Lord’s table. I think I gave that young
Hibbs fellow a setback last communion Sunday
which will prevent him from hustling up to the rail
before his betters.”</p>

<p>By which it will be seen that Dashaway’s unlucky
fiasco and the triumph of the long-legged roan at
Campdown had not been obliterated from the
Colonel’s memory. During the sermon, Colonel
Berkeley only took his eyes off the clergyman once.
This was when Mr. Hibbs came around with the collection
plate. The object of that day’s collection
was, as Mr. Cole had feelingly stated, for the conversion
of the higher castes in India. Colonel Berkeley
thrust both hands in his trousers’ pockets, and surveyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Mr. Hibbs defiantly as that worthy citizen
poked the plate at him. This duello between Mr.
Hibbs and Colonel Berkeley occurred every collection
Sunday, to the edification of the congregation.
After holding the plate before the Colonel for a considerable
time, Mr. Hibbs moved off&mdash;a time that
seemed interminable to Olivia, blushing furiously in
the corner of the pew.</p>

<p>After church the congregation streamed out, and
according to the country custom, the people stopped
to talk in the churchyard. Colonel Berkeley
marched up to Mr. Cole, and put something in his
hand.</p>

<p>“There, Cole,” he remarked, “I wouldn’t put
anything in the plate when that ruffian of a vestry-man
of yours poked it under my nose. But I
doubled my contribution, and I’ll thank you to put
it with the rest.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Colonel,” answered Mr. Cole&mdash;“but
Christian charity&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Christian charity be hanged, sir. I’m a Christian
and a churchman, but I prefer Christian gentlemen
to Methodist upstarts. Whether I go to
heaven or the other place either, damme, I propose
to go in good company.”</p>

<p>“This will go to the missionary fund for India,
Colonel.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! I’d like to see one of you callow
young clergymen tackle a Brahmin in India. By
Jove. It would be fun&mdash;for the Brahmin!”</p>

<p>Colonel Berkeley had no mind to let Mr. Cole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
monopolize Madame Koller, so just as the clergyman
stood, hat in hand bowing to her and her mother,
the Colonel marched up, and by a skillful maneuver
shoveled the elder lady off on Mr. Cole, while he himself
attended the younger one to the carriage. At
the churchyard gate was Olivia Berkeley talking
with Mrs. Peyton&mdash;and by her side stood French
Pembroke. Madame Koller smiled charmingly
at her old acquaintances. She was so sorry Miss
Berkeley had not been at home the day she
called. Miss Berkeley was politely regretful. It
was so sunshiny and delightful that Madame Koller
would like to walk as far as the main road led
them toward home&mdash;it was only across a field or
two then, for each of them to reach home. Olivia
also assented to this. Madame Koller’s society
was far from lacking charm to her&mdash;and besides,
the attraction of repulsion is never stronger than
between two women who cherish a smoldering
spark of jealousy.</p>

<p>Madame Koller wanted the Colonel to come, and
brought her whole battery of smiles and glances
into action to compel him&mdash;but he got out of it
with much astuteness. He was no walker, he said.
Then she turned to French Pembroke.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, my dear,” said Mrs. Peyton to Olivia,
<i>sotto voce</i>. “Don’t be left at the meeting of the
ways.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t, I promise you,” replied Olivia.</p>

<p>Off they started. Madame Koller moved with the
grace of a fairy in a drawing-room, but on a country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
road, holding a sunshade in one hand and her gown
in the other, it was a promenade rather than a
walk. Olivia walked with the easy step of a girl
country born and country bred, and albeit it was a
little more than a saunter, she soon walked Madame
Koller out of breath.</p>

<p>Pembroke had but little share in the conversation.
Except a laughing reference to him occasionally,
he was left out, and had full opportunity to
compare the two women&mdash;which he did with an
amused smile. Compliments were plenty from
Madame Koller, which Olivia deftly parried or
ignored. In a little while the turning was in sight
where both left the high road, and a path in one
direction led to Isleham, and in another, gave a
short cut to The Beeches. Pembroke was beginning
to apprehend an awkward predicament for
himself as to which one of the ladies he should
accompany, when Olivia cut the knot.</p>

<p>“Here I must leave you&mdash;good-bye, Madame Koller,
I shall see you during the week&mdash;good-bye&mdash;”
to Pembroke.</p>

<p>“There is Madame Koller’s carriage in sight,”
remarked Pembroke, thinking that offered a solution
of the problem&mdash;to which Olivia only responded
pleasantly&mdash;“Good-bye&mdash;good-bye&mdash;” and tripped
off.</p>

<p>Madame Koller looked rather foolish&mdash;she had
been outgeneraled completely.</p>

<p>“There is your carriage,” again said Pembroke,
this time looking straight at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. I know it. You will soon be rid of me.”</p>

<p>As she spoke her eyes filled with real tears of
mortification. Pembroke was a man, and he could
not see this, and be as hard as he meant to be.
Nevertheless, he did not intend to walk through the
field with Madame Koller.</p>

<p>“Come, Elise,” he said. “The way is too long
for you. You are no walker. It would be best for
you to drive home.”</p>

<p>“When you call me Elise I will do anything for
you,” she said&mdash;and she was really tired and hated
walking for walking’s sake.</p>

<p>The carriage drew up, and Pembroke put her in
carefully. Old Madame Schmidt said: “That is
right, Eliza,” and they drove off.</p>

<p>A few yards hid him from their sight, and at that
instant he struck out in the path to Isleham. In
ten minutes he had overtaken Olivia.</p>

<p>She was surprised to see him.</p>

<p>“What have you done with Madame Koller?”</p>

<p>“Put her in the carriage and sent her home.”</p>

<p>A faint flush crept into Olivia’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“I have wanted to ask you something for a week
or two,” she said, “but this is my first opportunity.
You know that poor negro, Bob Henry, who is to
be tried for murder&mdash;I believe he belonged to you,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“His wife was my maid when I was a child. Yesterday
she came to see me&mdash;just out of her bed
from a long fever. She is naturally in great trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
about her husband, whom she has not seen, the jail
being too far off. She has heard something about
your defending him when he is tried, and she
begged me to see you, and ask you as a mercy to
them, to ‘try him,’ as she says.”</p>

<p>“That is what brought me back to America,”
he replied.</p>

<p>Olivia said not a word, but walked on. She could
not but believe him&mdash;but if he had not come on
Madame Koller’s account, Madame Koller might
have come on his account.</p>

<p>“I have done, and I am doing, the best I can for
the poor fellow. Cave has helped me much.”</p>

<p>Then it occurred to Olivia that at least Pembroke
ought to get the credit for coming on such an
errand.</p>

<p>“How kind it was of you,” she said. “I am so
glad&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To find I am not such a scamp as you thought
me?” he said, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Have it any way you like,” she replied. “But
I am very glad, and Jane will be very glad, and I’m
sure Bob Henry is&mdash;and you may come home with
me and have some luncheon, and papa will be very
glad&mdash;he hates Sunday afternoons in the country.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> poor Mr. Ahlberg, condemned to
the solitude of the village tavern, varied by daily
visits to The Beeches and occasional ones to his
acquaintances, the Pembrokes and the Berkeleys,
found life tedious. He wanted to get away, but
Madame Koller would not let him. Mr. Ahlberg
had now, for some years, had an eye to Madame
Koller’s fortune. Therefore, when she commanded
him to stay, he stayed. He regarded her infatuation
for Pembroke as a kind of temporary insanity,
which would in time be cured, and that he would
be the physician and would marry his patient
afterward.</p>

<p>As for Madame Koller, she was wretched, anxious,
everything but bored. That she was not&mdash;she
was too miserable. Like Ahlberg, she thought
herself almost a lunatic. Hers was not the folly of
a guileless girl, but the deep-seated and unspeakable
folly of a matured woman. When M. Koller
died she had regarded herself as one of the most
fortunate women in the world. Still young, rich,
pretty, what more could she ask? The world had
almost forgotten, if it ever knew, that she had had a
stage career, when stage careers were not the most
desirable things in the world. She had done her
duty as well as she knew it by the dead and gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Koller, who, in consideration of leaving her a comfortable
fortune, had made her life a torment upon
earth. Just when she was preparing to enjoy her
liberty she had found herself enslaved by her own
act as it were. Sometimes she asked herself contemptuously
what Pembroke could give her if she
married him, in exchange for liberty which she
prized, and answered herself with the wisdom of
the world. Again she reasoned with herself and
got for answer the wildest folly a girl of sixteen
could imagine. With him was everything&mdash;without
him was nothing. And his indifference piqued
her. She truly believed him quite callous to any
woman, and she had often heard him say that he
had no intention of marrying. Pembroke, returning
to the life of a country gentleman after four years’
campaigning, followed by a time of thoughtless
pleasure, mixed with the pain of defeat, of the
misery of seeing Miles forever wretched, broken
in fortune, though not in spirit, found Madame
Koller’s society quite fascinating enough. But he
was not so far gone that he did not see the abyss
before him. On the one hand was money and
luxury and pleasure and idleness and Madame
Koller, with her blonde hair and her studied
graces and her dramatic singing&mdash;and on the other
was work and perhaps poverty, and a dull provincial
existence. But then he would be a man&mdash;and
if he married Madame Koller he would not be a
man. It is no man’s part to live solely for any
woman, and nobody knew that better than French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
Pembroke. Of course, he knew that he could
marry her&mdash;the love-making, such as it was, had
been chiefly on the lady’s part. He was angry beyond
measure with her when she appeared upon the
scene. He wished to try life without Madame Koller.
But when she came she certainly drew him
often to The Beeches. There was but one other
woman in the county who really interested him.
This was Olivia Berkeley, and she was uncertain
and hard to please. It was undeniably pleasant to
ride over to The Beeches on winter afternoons and
find Madame Koller in a cosy sitting room before
a wood fire, and to have her read to him and sing
to him. Sometimes he wondered how he ever
came away unpledged. Again, he faintly blamed
himself for going&mdash;but if he remained away Madame
Koller sent for him and reproached him bitterly.
She knew quite as much of the world as he
did&mdash;and he was no mean proficient&mdash;and was two
or three years older than he besides. But it was an
unsatisfactory existence to him. He felt when he
went from Madame Koller’s presence into Olivia’s
like going from a ball room out into the clear
moonlit night. To be on his guard always against
a woman, to try and make the best of an anomalous
condition, was offensive to his naturally
straightforward mind. It relieved him to be with
Olivia, even though occasionally she treated him
cavalierly. This last he positively relished as a
luxury.</p>

<p>Ahlberg he hated. Yet they were scrupulously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
polite to each other, and Ahlberg occasionally
dined with him at Malvern.</p>

<p>One day he met Ahlberg in the road near the
village. Ahlberg had a gun and a full game-bag
slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“You have had good luck,” said Pembroke.</p>

<p>“Very,” answered Ahlberg, with his peculiar
smile. “I saw nothing to shoot, but I met two
blacks, and for a trifle I bought all this. I am not
a sportsman like you. I go for a walk&mdash;I take my
gun. I want a few birds for an entrée. It matters
very little where I get them.”</p>

<p>“What we call a pot hunter,” remarked Pembroke,
laughing at what he considered great simplicity
on Ahlberg’s part. For his own part, his
instincts of sport made him consider Ahlberg’s
method of securing an entrée as but little better
than sheep stealing. Ahlberg did not quite take
in what manner of sport pot hunting was, nor the
contumely visited upon a pot hunter, and so was
not offended.</p>

<p>“Will you not come to The Beeches to-morrow
evening and dine with us on these birds?” he asked.
“This is <i>my</i> party, not Elise’s, who is ill with a distressing
cold. I have asked the Reverend Cole too,
and Hibbs and some others, and we will have a
‘jollitime’ as you Americans and English say.”</p>

<p>Pembroke agreed, he scarcely knew why, particularly
as he seldom dined at The Beeches, and
never before at Ahlberg’s invitation.</p>

<p>Next evening therefore with Mr. Cole and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
Hibbs and young Peyton and two or three others
Pembroke found himself in the great, gloomy dining
room at The Beeches. Neither Madame Koller
nor Madame Schmidt were present. The cold was
a real cold. Madame Koller was on the sofa in her
sitting room, and if she felt strong enough, sent
word to the guests she would see them in the
drawing-room later on. The round table though,
in the middle of the room, looked cheerful enough,
and on the sideboard was an array of long-necked
bottles such as Pembroke had never seen for so
small a party.</p>

<p>Ahlberg was an accomplished diner out&mdash;but that
is something different from a good diner at home.
He was graceful and attentive, but he lacked altogether
the Anglo-Saxon good fellowship. He
tucked a napkin under his chin, discussed ménus
with much gravity, and referred too often to Hans,
a nondescript person whom Madame Koller had
brought from Vienna, and who was cook, butler,
major-domo and valet in one&mdash;and highly accomplished
in all. Pembroke was rather disgusted with
too much conversation of this sort:</p>

<p>“Hans, you are too pronounced with your
truffles. There should be a hint&mdash;a mere suspicion&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur. But madame likes truffles.
Every day it is ‘Hans, you are too sparing of your
truffles.’”</p>

<p>“This salmi is really charming. Hans, I shall
put it down in my note book.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“I can give monsieur admirable salmis of pigeons
as well as duck.”</p>

<p>Pembroke, impelled by a spirit of perverseness,
declined everything Ahlberg and Hans united in
praising, and confined himself solely to port, a
wine he did not much care for, and which both
Ahlberg and Hans reprobated in the strongest
terms.</p>

<p>Not so Mr. Cole. He went religiously through
the ménu, praising and exclaiming, and keeping up
a fusillade of compliments like the chorus in a
Greek play. Nor did he forget the long-necked
bottles. At first he positively declined anything
but claret. But obeying a look from Ahlberg,
Hans filled the clergyman’s glass with champagne.
Mr. Cole laughed and blushed, but on being good
naturedly rallied by his companions, especially Mr.
Hibbs, he consented to one&mdash;only one glass. But
this was followed by a second, poured out when
Mr. Cole was looking another way&mdash;and presently
as Hans by degrees slyly filled the half dozen wine
glasses at his plate, Mr. Cole began with an air of
perfect unconsciousness to taste them all. Soon
his face flushed, and by the time the dinner was
half over, Mr. Cole was half over the line of moderation
too. He became convivial, and even affectionate.
Pembroke, who had looked on the little
clergyman’s first glass of champagne with a smile,
began to feel sorry for him, and a very profound
contempt for his entertainer. Hans and his
pseudo-master evidently understood each other, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
exchanged glances oftener than master and man
usually do. As the clergyman became more free in
his talk, Ahlberg looked at Pembroke with a foxy
smile, but received only a cool stare in return.
Pembroke was a jolly companion enough, but this
deliberately making a gentleman, weak as he might
be, but still a gentleman, drunk in a woman’s house
struck him as not the most amusing thing in the
world. Ahlberg, however, seemed to enjoy the
state of affairs, and though he had no sympathy
from Pembroke or young Peyton, Mr. Hibbs and
one or two others appreciated it highly.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Cole,” he cried, “you know how to
dine, I see you do. You would not discredit the
Trois Frères itself. Hans, more Chablis.”</p>

<p>Poor Cole’s eyes twinkled. He loved to be
thought a man of the world.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you give us a song, Mr. Cole?” continued
Ahlberg, laughing, “English and American
fashion, you know. Something about wine and
mirth.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cole smiled coquettishly, and cleared his
throat.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I might try ‘The Heart Bowed Down
With Weight of Woe,’” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Or, ‘Then You’ll Remember Me.’ That’s more
sentimental&mdash;more suited for the occasion.”</p>

<p>“‘Then You’ll Remember Me,’ by all means.
Gentlemen, a chorus.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cole, placing his hand upon his heart, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
having drained another glass of champagne, began
in a weak and rather shaky voice,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘When other lips and other hearts</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Their tales of love shall tell.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Gentlemen, I’m not in good voice to-night.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘In language whose excess imparts</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The power they feel so well;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When hollow hearts shall wear a mask,’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Here, Hans, old boy, I’ll take another glass of
Chablis&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘’Twill break your own to see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In such a moment I but a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;sk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That you’ll remember me.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here a tremendous chorus, led by Mr. Ahlberg,
broke in, accompanied with much pounding on the
table, and a rhythmic jingling of glasses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then you’ll remember me, boys,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then you’ll remember me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Cole, very much annoyed and preposterously
dignified, began to protest.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen&mdash;er&mdash;beloved brethren, I mean gentlemen,
this song is a sentimental one&mdash;a sentimental
song, d’ye hear&mdash;and does not admit of a
convivial chorus. Now, I’ll give you the last verse
over.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cole, looking lackadaisically at the ceiling,
began again. When he reached the last line, again
an uproarious chorus took the words out of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
mouth. He rose, and steadying himself on his feet,
implored silence in pantomime. In vain. Ahlberg
and Hibbs with shouts and yells of laughter carried
the chorus through. Pembroke could not but
laugh, but he said to the little clergyman, in a tone
subdued but authoritative:</p>

<p>“Sit down, Cole.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cole glanced fiercely at him. “Were it
not for my cloth, sir, you&mdash;you’d&mdash;receive personal
chastisement for that remark,” he responded
angrily; but comparing his own slender figure with
Pembroke’s length and strength, he plaintively continued:</p>

<p>“But I’m afraid you could lick me, Pembroke.
You always did at school, you know.”</p>

<p>Pembroke made no reply. He was no anchorite.
He had sometimes found amusement in low company
in low places&mdash;but low company in better
places disgusted him. Besides, Cole was an honest
little fellow, and not half such a fool as he appeared&mdash;and
he had a conscience, and Pembroke began
to feel sorry already for the pain poor Cole would
have to endure.</p>

<p>But Cole was not the only subject of amusement.
Ahlberg, now that his dinner was over, considered
conversation in order&mdash;and began to give his views
on things in general, upon which young Hibbs and
young Peyton and the others hung with delight.
Pembroke therefore thinking it well to get Cole out
of the way while he could yet walk, suggested that
he should escape for a breath of fresh air&mdash;to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Cole assented, and might have slipped out unnoticed,
but for his assumption of a lofty stride,
which would have landed him on the floor but for
a timely arm from Hans.</p>

<p>The fun grew fast and furious, and everybody at
the table was flushed except Ahlberg and Pembroke.
Ahlberg drank as much as anybody, but
his delicate hand was as steady, and his cold blue
eyes as clear as if it had been water from the well
he was drinking. Pembroke did not drink much
and remained cool and smiling.</p>

<p>After an hour or two had passed, he began to
be intensely bored by Mr. Hibbs’ songs, who now
became the minstrel, Ahlberg’s long stories and
young Peyton’s jokes&mdash;and besides he wondered at
Mr. Cole’s absence. So in the midst of a lively discussion,
he quietly left his seat and went out.</p>

<p>In the hall several doors opened&mdash;but from the
drawing-room door came a flood of light, and
voices. He heard Madame Koller’s somewhat
shrill tones saying:</p>

<p>“But Mr. Cole, I cannot marry you&mdash;fancy
me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Darling Eliza,” cried Mr. Cole, in a maudlin,
tipsy voice. “I know you love me. Your partiality&mdash;”</p>

<p>Pembroke made two strides to the door. Just
as he reached it, he saw a tableau. Mr. Cole, whose
head just reached to Madame Koller’s shoulder,
had seized her by the waist and was saying:</p>

<p>“One kiss&mdash;only one, my darling!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>Madame Koller raised her hand&mdash;it was large
and strong and white&mdash;and brought it down upon
the clergyman’s cheek with a thundering whack
that would have knocked him down, but for another
slap she administered on the other side.
Pembroke had not been in time to save him, but
he caught Cole by the collar, and picking him up
as if he had been a baby, set him out of the way.</p>

<p>Madame Koller was raging. She stamped her
foot and clinched her hands and ground her teeth
with passion.</p>

<p>“Come, Madame Koller,” said Pembroke, sternly,
“there is no occasion for this sort of thing. The little
fool is tipsy&mdash;of course you see it. You ought
not to have had anything to say to him.”</p>

<p>But Madame Koller would not be pacified. It
was not the liberty he had tried to take which most
infuriated her, she inadvertently declared, but the
idea that she, Elise Koller, would marry a country
parson. She raved. What! She, Elise Koller,
born a Peyton, should condescend to that ridiculous
person? What would her aunt, Sally Peyton,
say to it? What would the shade of the departed
Koller say to it? She had been civil to him, and
forsooth, he had come, like a thief in the night, and
proposed to marry her&mdash;her, who might have married
a duke&mdash;a prince&mdash;anybody. Madame Koller
was very mad, and used just the extravagant and
hysterical language that people of her type do
sometimes.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Cole, those two slaps had sobered him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
as instantly and as completely as anything could.
He sat bolt upright on the sofa, while Pembroke
with a half smile of contempt in his face that really
exasperated Madame Koller more than poor Cole
had done, listened to her tirade. What a virago
the woman was, to be sure. But how handsome
she was too!</p>

<p>“Pembroke,” said poor Cole, rising and coming
forward, looking quite pale and desperate, “don’t
try to excuse me. I don’t deserve any excuse. I
mean to write to the bishop to-morrow and make a
clean breast of it&mdash;and any punishment he may
inflict, or any mortification I may have to endure
because of this, I’ll take like a man. Madame
Koller, I humbly ask your pardon. I hardly knew
what I was doing.”</p>

<p>“To get drunk in my house,” was Madame
Koller’s reply.</p>

<p>“Hardly that,” said Pembroke, quietly. “Made
drunk by your precious cousin, Ahlberg.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send Louis away if you desire me,” cried
Madame Koller, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I desire nothing of the kind. It is no affair of
mine. Come, Cole, you’ve done the best you could
by apologizing. I’ll see that those fellows say nothing
about it. Good evening, Madame Koller.”</p>

<p>“Must you go, Pembroke&mdash;now&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Immediately. Good-bye,” and in two minutes
he and Cole were out of the house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> say that Pembroke was angry with Cole is
hardly putting it strong enough. He ardently
longed that he might once again inflict a thrashing
upon him like those Cole had been wont to receive
in his school days. He had taken the little clergyman
to Malvern, and kept him a day or two before
sending him home to his mother. Cole’s remorse
was pitiful. He wanted to write to the whole House
of Bishops, to make a public reparation, to do a
number of quixotic things which Pembroke’s strong
sense forbade peremptorily. When after two days
of sincere, but vociferous penitence, Mr. Cole was
at last sent back to his rectory, he went under strict
instructions from Pembroke to keep his misfortune
to himself. But alas for poor Cole! What stung
him most was that Madame Koller should have
seen him in that condition&mdash;for the two hard slaps
that she had given him had by no means cured his
infatuation. On the contrary, her strong nerves, her
fierce temper, her very recklessness of conventionality,
irresistibly attracted his timid and conservative
nature. What had offended Pembroke, who
looked for a certain feminine restraint in all women,
and gentleness, even in daring, had charmed Cole.
His anguish, when he found, that in addition to
his paroxysm of shame, he suffered tortures because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
he could no longer see Madame Koller, almost
frightened him into convulsions.</p>

<p>Pembroke had meant to be very prudent with Ahlberg,
and particularly to avoid anything like a dispute.
He felt that the natural antagonism between
them would be likely to produce a quarrel unless
he were remarkably careful, and as he regarded
Ahlberg with great contempt, he had a firm determination
never to give him either cause or chance
of offense. According to the tradition in which he
had been raised, a quarrel between two men was
liable to but one outcome&mdash;an archaic one, it is
true, but one which made men extremely cautious
and careful not to offend. If a blow once passed it
became a tragedy. Pembroke promised himself
prudence, knowing that he had not the coolest
temper in the world. But when, some days after
the dinner, they met, this time in the road also, and
Ahlberg’s first remark was “What capital fun we
had with our friend Cole!” Pembroke’s temper
instantly got the better of him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ahlberg, do you think it quite a gentlemanly
thing to invite a man like Cole to accept
your hospitality in a woman’s house, and then
deliberately to make him drunk?” asked he.</p>

<p>Ahlberg’s sallow skin grew a little paler.</p>

<p>“Is that your view?” he asked, coolly. “I
understand something occurred with Madame Koller,
which you naturally resent.”</p>

<p>As Ahlberg’s face grew whiter, Pembroke’s grew
redder. He felt that first savage impulse to seize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Ahlberg and shake him as a mastiff would a terrier.
He stood still for a moment or two and then stepping
up close to Ahlberg, said to him: “You are
a scoundrel.”</p>

<p>Ahlberg grew perfectly rigid. This blunt, Anglo-Saxon
way of picking a quarrel amazed him. He
brought his heels together, and stood up very erect,
in the first position of dancing, and said:</p>

<p>“This is most extraordinary. Does Monsieur
know that but one result can follow this?”</p>

<p>“Anything you please,” answered Pembroke,
carelessly, “but if you force me to fight I will certainly
kill you. You know something of my pistol
practice.”</p>

<p>Ahlberg hesitated a moment, and then drawing
up his sleeve, exposed a great red knot on his right
arm.</p>

<p>“If I desired to take advantage of you I might
say that you knew my pistol arm was disabled. I
got this six months ago&mdash;and it will be six months
more before it is well. The paralysis is still partial.
But as soon as I can trust it, you will hear from
me.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” answered Pembroke.</p>

<p>Then they touched their hats ceremoniously,
and went their way, Pembroke plunging through
the brushwood on the side of the road with his dog
at his heels.</p>

<p>Pembroke never despised himself more than at
that moment. Here was he involved in a quarrel
with a man for whom he felt a thorough contempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
in every respect, and against which he had
particularly warned himself.</p>

<p>As to the method of settling the trouble proposed,
that his own good sense condemned, albeit it was
still in vogue in Virginia. In the heat of anger he
had promised Ahlberg to kill him&mdash;while he, Pembroke,
knew in his heart, that certainly nothing Ahlberg
could say or do, would make him deliberately
carry out any such intention. But the folly, wickedness,
petulance, want of self-command that brought
the quarrel about, enraged him more with himself
than with Ahlberg. He could imagine Cave’s cool
and cutting disapproval&mdash;Colonel Berkeley’s uproarious
and vociferous protest. He knew his own folly
in the case so well, that he fancied everybody else
must know it too. At all events, the trouble was
postponed, and he felt prepared to do a great deal,
even to the extent of apologizing to Ahlberg, rather
than fight him. And then Elise. What a creature
she was to be sure&mdash;singing to him to charm him,
and declaiming poetry like the tragic muse&mdash;and
then that scene with Cole, at which the recollection
even made him shudder and laugh too. Why
couldn’t he fall thoroughly in love with Olivia Berkeley?
Probably she would refuse him tartly, but at
least it would rid him of Madame Koller, and it
would be a bracing, healthy experience. He had half
a mind to go back and suggest to Ahlberg that they
observe their usual terms toward each other until
the time came that Ahlberg might demand satisfaction.
A strained demeanor would be peculiarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
unpleasant, considering the way the people at The
Beeches and the Berkeleys and Miles and himself
were associated. But he reflected that Ahlberg
was a man of the world, and would probably let
things go on smoothly, anyhow. It turned out he
was correct, as the next time they met, Ahlberg’s
manner was imperturbable, and the cold politeness
which had always existed between the two men
was not visibly changed.</p>

<p>Walking along, and cutting viciously with his
stick at the harmless bushes in the path on this particular
day, he soon found himself near the fence
that ran around the lawn at Isleham. He concluded
he would go in and see the Berkeleys for half
an hour. It would be a refreshing change from
Madame Koller and Ahlberg to Olivia’s pure, bright
face and the Colonel’s jovial, wholesome chaff. It
was a mild, spring-like day in early winter. The
path led to the lawn through the old-fashioned garden,
where everything was brown and sere except
the box hedge that stiffly bordered the straight,
broad path that led through the garden. He remembered
having heard Miles at breakfast say
something about going over to Isleham, and was
therefore not surprised to see him walking up and
down the path with Olivia. She had a book in her
hand and was reading in her low, clear voice, aloud
to him as they walked slowly, and Miles was following
what she read closely, occasionally stopping
to ask a question and looking quite cheerful and
interested. It came back to him that Miles had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
spoken of Olivia and himself taking up Italian
together. From her manner, and from the expression
on her charming face in its little black velvet
hood, he saw she was doing it for Miles’ sake.
He loved that younger brother as well as one
human being ever loved another. To have saved
the boy one pang he would have done much&mdash;but
he could do so little! Miles was no longer fit for
field sports, society he shunned, reading he could
do for himself. Pembroke felt every day the masculine
inability to console. Yet here was this girl
who had found something to interest poor little
Miles, and was doing it with the sweetest womanliness
in the world. She probably cared nothing for
Italian, but Miles was fond of it.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Olivia, with authority, as he came
up. “Don’t speak a word. I must let you see
how well I can read this,” and she read a stanza
correctly enough.</p>

<p>“That will do,” remarked Pembroke, who knew
something of Italian, “you were wise to choose that
Francesca da Rimini story though. It is the easiest
part in the whole book.”</p>

<p>Olivia slammed the volume together indignantly,
and drew down her pretty brows in a frown.</p>

<p>“You and papa are always laughing at us. Never
mind Miles, <i>I</i> don’t mind them I assure you.”</p>

<p>Pembroke went in and remained to luncheon, as
did Miles. The Colonel was in great spirits. He
had had a brush on the road with Mrs. Peyton, and
had been over to The Beeches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“And by the way, Pembroke, what’s this I hear
about poor Cole getting as tight as Bacchus the
other night at The Beeches?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” answered Pembroke. He did
not mean to say anything about Ahlberg’s share
in it, considering the relations between them, but
the Colonel was too sharp for him.</p>

<p>“Now, Cole wouldn’t go and do a thing like that
unless he was put up to it. Didn’t our friend
with the waxed mustache have something to do
with it, eh? Oh, yes, I see he did.”</p>

<p>Pembroke smiled at the way Colonel Berkeley
read his face. Olivia spoke up with spirit.</p>

<p>“Papa, I hate that Mr. Ahlberg. Pray don’t
have him here any more.”</p>

<p>But the Colonel looked quite crestfallen at this.
Ahlberg amused him, and life was very, very dull
for him.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t insist on that, my dear,” he
said, and Olivia answered:</p>

<p>“I can’t when you look that way.”</p>

<p>Much relieved, the Colonel began again. “And
Madame Koller, I hear&mdash;ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“Papa!”</p>

<p>The note of dreadful warning in Olivia’s voice
vexed Pembroke. But he could not explain and
she would not understand.</p>

<p>Afterward, the two brothers walking along
briskly toward home, Miles said:</p>

<p>“Do you know I believe Ahlberg is making love
to Olivia on the sly!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>Pembroke felt an infinite disgust at this&mdash;Ahlberg
with his waxed mustache, and his napkin tucked
in his waistcoat, and his salmis and his truffles,
making love to Olivia Berkeley!</p>

<p>“He doesn’t want Madame Koller to know it,
though, I’ll warrant,” continued Miles. “Anybody
can see his game there.”</p>

<p>“If he asks Olivia to marry him there will be
another ear-boxing episode in this neighborhood,”
said Pembroke with a short laugh.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Poor</span> Bob Henry, shut up in the county jail,
had indeed said aright when he wrote Pembroke
that both blacks and whites were “agin him.”
Pembroke could scarcely find one of the negro
race to testify to Bob Henry’s previous good character&mdash;and
as he sifted his own evidence and surmised
the State’s, he saw that but for the witness
Cave had ferreted out, things would indeed have
looked black for Bob Henry. At that time the
apprehension as to the way the negroes in their
freedom would behave toward the whites was as
yet sinister, and the Hibbses, whose relative the
dead man was, worked up the feeling against his
supposed murderer with considerable astuteness.
They were among the largest subscribers to Mr.
Cole’s salary, and as such they gave their views
freely to Mr. Cole upon the impropriety of his going
to see Bob Henry in jail, and exerting himself to
stem the tide against him among the black people.</p>

<p>Mr. Cole’s fair little face flushed up at this criticism
delivered from old Mr. Hibbs in a loud and
dictatorial voice on the court house green before a
crowd of persons.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hibbs&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;am a minister of the gospel,
sir, and my duty is to condole with the afflicted, sir,&mdash;and&mdash;however
sir,&mdash;whatever may be your opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
of that poor wretch in the jail yonder, and however
it may conduce to&mdash;to&mdash;unpopularity, I shall continue
to visit him. I have sympathy with the erring,”
he said, remembering that terrible evening at
The Beeches.</p>

<p>A heavy hand descended upon Mr. Cole’s shoulder,
and Colonel Berkeley’s handsome face shone at
him.</p>

<p>“Right you are, Cole. You’re a little prig sometimes,
but you are something of a man, sir&mdash;something
of a man!”</p>

<p>Mr. Cole blushed with pleasure at this dubious
compliment.</p>

<p>Olivia Berkeley’s heart was touched with pity
for the unfortunate negro. His ailing wife came
every day to tell the same rambling and piteous
story. Besides, Cave had been at work with her&mdash;and
he had great power with young imaginations.
Pembroke felt a certain anxiety about the case. It
was one of those which gave room for the sympathetic
oratory which in the country districts in the
South yet obtains. He felt at first that if he could
make the jury weep, his success as a lawyer would
be assured and immediate. But if he failed it would
mean long years of toil at his profession to gain that
which by a happy inspiration he could win at a
single <i>coup</i>. He worked hard, and prepared himself&mdash;not
solely for oratory, because the Hibbses
had not only engaged a formidable array of local
talent, but had got one, if not two great men from
afar, and the attorney-general himself, to help the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
state. Pembroke went to Cave despondent and
nervous about this.</p>

<p>“It is the best thing in the world for you,”
answered Cave. “Don’t you see, the prosecution
has taken the form of a persecution? And the
bringing in of outside talent is the greatest luck I
ever heard of. The jury, if I know anything of
human nature, will not try the prisoner according
to the law and the evidence. They will try you
and the lawyers from elsewhere&mdash;with a strong predisposition
in favor of their own county man. It
will go hard with them if they can’t find some way
to discount the outsiders. Of course, I don’t say
that this feeling will be immediately developed, but
it will come out just as certainly as arithmetical
progression.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” Pembroke answered devoutly.</p>

<p>The day of the trial came&mdash;a sunshiny one in
midwinter. Every man in the county turned out.
Nothing delights a rural Virginian so much as a
forensic argument. He will ride twenty miles to
hear it, and sit it out, in cold, or heat, or wet, or
misery, or anything. Then, besides the interest
naturally attaching to the case, was the curiosity
to see and hear Pembroke. He had not added to
his popularity by his absence after the war&mdash;and
Madame Koller had been a millstone around his
neck latterly. His father and his grandfather and
his great-grandfather had been great lawyers before
him&mdash;indeed there was no tradition or history
which went back to the time when there had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
been a Pembroke practicing successfully at the bar
in the county. So while there was a current of
disapproval against him, there was a strong undercurrent
of local sympathy in his favor also.</p>

<p>Pembroke appeared early on the ground that
morning, with Miles. It was his first opportunity
except at the Campdown races to meet the county
people of all classes generally. He went about
among them cool, affable, and smiling.</p>

<p>“Oyez, oyez, oyez!” the sheriff’s loud voice
rang out from the court house steps&mdash;and the
crowd poured into the old brick building, and Pembroke,
slipping in by another way entered upon
the strain which lasted for five days and nights.</p>

<p>Great as the crowd was at first, it increased every
day. Within two hours of the swearing in of the
jury, just what Cave had predicted came to pass.
The prosecution saw that the jury was on the side
of a Pembroke&mdash;the Pembrokes had always been
prime favorites with juries in that county, and the
present one was no exception. Naturally, this
nettled the attorney-general and the other great
men who appeared for the State. It was certainly an
exasperating thing to come so far to find twelve men
obstinately bent on seeing things from the point of
view of a handsome, plausible young advocate.
The court, however, was all that could be desired.
The attorney-general expressed his belief to his
colleagues that if French Pembroke relied upon an
eloquent speech, and the precedent of a Pembroke
always carrying the winning colors in a jury trial,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
he would be mistaken&mdash;because Judge Randolph,
silent and grim, looked keenly after the law. It
was, as Pembroke knew, no easy undertaking to face
the array of lawyers before him. Like them, he
was shrewd enough to see that it would be a poor
triumph to obtain a verdict that would not stand.
Bob Henry became to him merely an incident.
He looked day after day, during the trial, at the
negro’s ashy, scared face in the prisoner’s dock, and
sometimes felt a kind of wonder that a creature
so ignorant and so inconsequential could be of
such tremendous importance to any human being.
For Bob Henry took up Pembroke’s mind, his soul,
his nights, his days. He worked all day for him,
the tension never weakening from the time he
entered the court room in the morning, until by
the light of sputtering candles he saw Bob Henry
walked off in the sheriff’s custody at night. Then
Pembroke would go to his little office, and lighting
his lamp, begin work on his books and his notes.
Even Cave and Miles were unwelcome then. He
was engaged in a fierce intellectual struggle that
he must fight out for himself. He had meant in
the beginning to keep himself in condition, but he
found out that it was one of the times when the
soul triumphs over the body. He would throw
himself on the lounge in his office toward daylight
and snatch three or four hours of heavy and dreamless
sleep, and then wake up with his faculties as
keen and tireless as if he had slept for a week. He
did not grow haggard and wild-eyed as men sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
do under these excitements. He was pale,
but singularly self-possessed and alert, and looked
invariably trim and composed. He forgot everything
in those days but the negro he was trying to
save from the gallows. The lawyers who opposed
him pounded him unmercifully. They too, caught
the infection of enthusiasm. It would be scandalous
to be beaten by an untried hand in such a case
as that, with such admirable fighting ground as
they had.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when the court adjourned early
on account of a slight illness of one of the jurors,
Pembroke mounted his horse and rode off far into
the woodlands. When he was out of sight of the
village he put spurs to his horse and dashed along
the country road. It did him good. He felt
already as if he had gained strength enough to last
him even at the rate he was using it up if the trial
should last two weeks more. Presently he brought
his horse down to a walk, and enjoyed the strange
restfulness and strength he felt possessing him.
Suddenly he came face to face with Olivia Berkeley,
riding quietly along the same road.</p>

<p>It would be no exaggeration to say he had forgotten
her existence. He had not thought once of
her or of Madame Koller, or Ahlberg, anybody but
Bob Henry. It had not been ten days since he
had seen her, but he felt as if it had been ten years.
She looked very pretty and Amazon-like on her
light-built black, in her close habit.</p>

<p>“Papa tells me great things of you,” she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
after the first greeting. “He is up, storming and
swearing for breakfast by sunrise, so as to be at the
court-house by nine o’clock. I never expected to
see him so happy again in dear old Virginia. It is
some excitement for him. As for Jane, she is beginning
to think Bob Henry a martyr and a hero
combined.”</p>

<p>Pembroke smiled. It was not the first praise
that had reached his ears, but the first that he had
heeded. He had quite lost sight in the last few
extraordinary days of any outside view of what he
was doing&mdash;but praise from a pretty woman&mdash;especially
praise so obviously sincere, is dear to
man’s heart.</p>

<p>“I am sorry the Colonel should be so uproarious
in consequence of the trial.”</p>

<p>“He is, I assure you. But I&mdash;I&mdash;too, feel very
great interest in your success. How much more
noble this is than dawdling on the continent! You
will not get any money by it, but think&mdash;the whole
county will admire and applaud you&mdash;and think of
those two poor black creatures.”</p>

<p>“You are crediting me with more than I
deserve,” he said, finding it difficult to explain that
what he was doing had long passed out of the region
of a desire for applause, and indeed, of the feeling
of compassion which had once inspired him. Now
it was the overpowering intellectual and natural
bent that was having its own way. Pembroke had
been born a lawyer, although he did not suspect it.</p>

<p>In taking his thoughts back to that remote period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
before the trial begun, Olivia had brought Madame
Koller to mind.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Elise&mdash;Madame Koller&mdash;lately?”
The first name slipped out involuntarily. He
rarely called Madame Koller by it at any time&mdash;but
now, by one of those tricks which memory serves
all people, her name came to his lips not only
without his will, but against it. His face turned a
deep red, and he bit his lip in anger and vexation.
Olivia straightened herself up on her horse and
smiled at him that peculiar indulgent smile, and
addressed him in those gentle tones that betokened
the freezing up of her sympathies and the coming
to life of her contempt. He knew only too well
the meaning of that appalling sweetness. “No, I
have not. But to-morrow I will probably see her.
Shall I remember you to her?”</p>

<p>“If you please,” replied Pembroke, wishing
Madame Koller at the devil, as he often did. Often&mdash;but
not always.</p>

<p>Then they drifted into commonplace, and presently
they parted, Pembroke galloping back to the
village, despising himself almost as much as the day
he had allowed his anger to lead him into the quarrel
with Ahlberg.</p>

<p>But when he reached his dingy little office, Olivia
Berkeley, Madame Koller, Ahlberg, all faded rapidly
out of his mind. That great game of skill in
which he was engaged, the stake being a human
life, again absorbed him. And then the critical
time came, when, after having tried to prove that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
the negro’s blow had not killed Hackett, he had to
bring out his theory that a dead and missing man
was the murderer. Hackett’s boon companions,
who formed a community of lawless loafers, had
been unaccountably shy about attending the trial.
Like the rest of their class, they regarded a sensational
murder trial as the most fascinating occasion
in life. They were great frequenters of the court
house, particularly of its low drinking places during
“court week,” but not one of them showed up in
the first days of the trial. Cave brought this significant
news to Pembroke, who knew few persons
in the miscellaneous crowd that he saw every day.
It made his heart beat hard and fast with the hope
of a coming success. The Hibbses and their retainers,
and a certain set of people who overcame their
dislike to the Hibbs family out of exaggerated sympathy
for a Northern man with Southern sympathies,
for which Hackett had posed, formed a kind of
camp to themselves in the court room.</p>

<p>The lawyers for the State found out that Pembroke
knew all the weak spots in their theory that
Bob Henry’s blow killed Hackett, but there was no
suspicion of any evidence forthcoming to support
Pembroke’s theory that another hand struck the
blow. Hackett’s association with the deserters had
evidently been carefully concealed by him, as it
would have ostracized him utterly.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Pembroke, putting off until the
last possible moment, summoned John Jones and
George Robinson and about a dozen others of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
“deserters’ gang,” as it was called, his opponents
were taken by surprise. One day only was taken
up with their evidence. Each witness, debarred by
Judge Randolph’s orders from communicating with
the other, told a rambling, lying, frightened story,
out of which Pembroke gleaned the midnight carousal,
a quarrel, a blow&mdash;all of them running away,
and leaving Hackett to his fate. In one point, however,
they all agreed&mdash;that the man, William Marsh,
who was fearfully cut by Hackett’s knife, and who
disappeared to die, was the one who struck the fatal
blow that knocked Hackett senseless, and from
which he never rallied. All were eager to lay it
on the dead man, and so to shift the suspicion from
themselves. The State, of course, impugned the
character of the witnesses, but that was a work of
supererogation. They had no characters to impugn.
Yet, both judge and jury saw, that without
the slightest objection to perjuring themselves on
the part of this precious gang, they were involuntarily
proving that Marsh, not Bob Henry, was the
murderer. Then Cave’s protégé, a small, ragged,
undersized boy of fifteen, was introduced. He was
diffident, and shy, and trembling in every limb, but
his testimony was perfectly plain and straightforward,
so much so that an eminent gentleman on
the side of the prosecution, roared out to him,
“Now, young man, tell us if this remarkably
straight story of yours didn’t have help from somewhere.
Have you talked with anybody about this
evidence?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“Y&mdash;y&mdash;yes, sir,” stammered the boy, frightened
half out of his life.</p>

<p>“Who was it?” thundered the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Cave.”</p>

<p>“Aha, I thought so. Now, sir, tell us what Mr.
Cave said to you&mdash;and be careful&mdash;very careful.”</p>

<p>The boy looked perfectly helpless and hopeless
for a moment. Pembroke almost felt himself
tremble.</p>

<p>“He said&mdash;he said, sir, some of the lawyers would
holler at me, and maybe confuse me&mdash;but if I jes’
stuck to the truth, and didn’t tell nothin’ but what
I seen with my own eyes, I’d come out all right!”</p>

<p>Shouts of applause greeted this, which the sheriff
vainly tried to quell. The great man remarked to
his personal staff, <i>sotto voce</i>, “It’s all up. Pembroke’s
case is too strong for us.”</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon of the fifth day when
Pembroke’s closing argument was over, and the
jury had been instructed and had retired. The
Judge’s instructions rather damped Pembroke’s
hopes. The testimony of the deserters, while actually
of great effect, was legally not worth much&mdash;their
motive in shoveling the blame on Marsh was
too obvious. And Cave’s protégé, although his
testimony was remarkably straightforward, was little
better than a vagabond boy. Pembroke was not
so sanguine of his own success as his opponents were.</p>

<p>The court house was dimly lighted by a few
sputtering candles and an ill-burning lamp. The
Judge sat up straight and stern, fatigued with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
long trial, but willing to wait until six o’clock, the
usual hour of adjournment, for the jury. The
shabby court-room was filled with men, eager, talkative,
but almost breathless with excitement&mdash;for
by some occult means, they divined that the jury
wouldn’t be long making up its verdict.</p>

<p>The negro sat in the dock, more ghastly, more
ashy than ever. Pembroke rose to go to his office.
He felt his iron nerve beginning to give way, but a
voice&mdash;piteous and pleading&mdash;reached him.</p>

<p>“Fur God’s sake, Marse French, doan’ go ’way.
I want you fur ter stay by me.”</p>

<p>Pembroke sat down again, this time a little
nearer the poor prisoner, whose eyes followed him
like a dog’s.</p>

<p>A hush settled down upon the audience. There
was no pretense of attending to any other business.
The opposing lawyers rested wearily in uncomfortable
postures about the court-room. They talked
in whispers among themselves. Pembroke knew
by instinct what they were saying. It was that the
jury was hopelessly gone, but that there remained
hope yet in the stern and silent Judge, whose
instructions had been brief and in no way indicative
of which way his judgment inclined. It was
not the result of this trial which concerned them, it
was the prospect of another.</p>

<p>Among practiced lawyers, nothing is easier to tell
than the views of a judge on a criminal case&mdash;after
the decision has been rendered. About an hour
of the suspense had been endured when a message<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
came that the jury had agreed upon a verdict.
The expectant crowd suddenly became hushed and
motionless. Not as wise as the lawyers, there was
utter uncertainty among them as to&mdash;not only
whether the prisoner was guilty or not, but
whether Pembroke alone and single-handed, had
vanquished the veterans before him.</p>

<p>The jury filed in and took their places, and the
formalities were gone through, when the foreman
said in a loud voice, “Not guilty.” A wild and
tumultuous cheering broke forth. Like the poor
prisoner, Pembroke felt dazed. The end was not
yet by any means. The opposing lawyers were on
their feet in a moment&mdash;the sheriff shouted for
order&mdash;and in the midst of this, a sudden silence
came and Pembroke found himself&mdash;he hardly knew
how&mdash;on the platform shaking hands with Judge
Randolph.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you, sir,” he heard the Judge’s
voice saying afar off. “You have maintained the
reputation of your distinguished father for the tact
and judgment with which you have defended your
client. You have a great career before you. It is
most encouraging to see such an example among
the younger members of the bar.”</p>

<p>Then there was a wild commotion. Pembroke felt
himself choking, trembling, utterly unable to reply.
The pause to hear what he would say became painfully
prolonged. He began “Your Honor”&mdash;and
after repeating it twice, became utterly dumb.</p>

<p>“You may retire, Mr. Pembroke,” said Judge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
Randolph, with a smile, “your modesty is equal to
your abilities.”</p>

<p>At this Pembroke felt himself seized by the legs.
The crowd carried him out into the night air where
another crowd yelled and shouted, he struggling and
breathless, and presenting a more undignified
appearance than he had ever imagined himself
capable of looking. The next thing he found himself
on the court-house steps. While in the din
and confusion, he recognized occasionally faces by
the light of the swinging lantern in the porch of
the building. In a moment the attorney-general
of the State appeared by his side&mdash;a handsome
florid man of sixty. He waved imperiously for
silence, and the crowd obeyed.</p>

<p>“My friends,” he said, in a strong, musical voice,
“our young friend here has made a magnificent
fight.” (Yells and cheers.) “He has done more
than make an eloquent speech. He has mastered
the law in the case.” (More yells and shouts.)
“It was the intention of my colleagues and myself
to move for a new trial. We have abandoned that
intention.” (Yells and shouts wilder and wilder.)
“We might possibly get a new trial on technicalities.
It would cost the county much, and it would not
subserve the cause of justice&mdash;for I cheerfully
acknowledge to you here, that our young friend
has proved conclusively that whoever caused the
death of the dead man, the prisoner did not. Now
will you not unite with me in giving him three
cheers and a tiger!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>The uproar was terrific. Pembroke could say
nothing, could do nothing, but bow. Suddenly an
inspiration came to him. He turned to the attorney-general
who stood behind him and shook hands
with him warmly. The other lawyers crowded
around him and shook hands. Somebody made
way through the crowd for Bob Henry. The negro
on seeing Pembroke broke into loud sobbing, and
seizing him in both arms called down blessings on
him. Then Colonel Berkeley shouldered his way
up to him with Miles. At every minute the
enthusiasm of the crowd increased. Pembroke was
growing deadly pale. The excitement, the sleeplessness,
of the last week was telling on him at last.
Colonel Berkeley, after a sharp glance at him, took
him by the arm, and by dint of hauling and pulling
succeeded in wedging his way with Pembroke
through the crowd, which in the hullaballoo and
semi-darkness, did not know that the hero of the
hour was gone, and yelled fiercely, “Speech!
Speech!” The attorney-general gratified them.</p>

<p>Colonel Berkeley hustled Pembroke down, back
through the court-room, out of a side door, and
through byways to where the Isleham carriage
stood, and clapped him in it, jumping in after him.</p>

<p>“Cave will look after Miles,” he said, and shouted
to Petrarch, who was on the box, “Home.” The
coachman laid the whip on his horses and they
made the five miles to Isleham in half an hour.</p>

<p>When they reached the house, everything was
too recent with Pembroke&mdash;his final speech, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
excitement, the relief, the collapse&mdash;for him to have
recovered himself. Olivia met them in the hall.
Her father, who relished a new sensation as only a
man who loves sensations can, was joyous.</p>

<p>“Congratulate him, my love,” he called out in
his merry, jovial voice. “He is a true son of old
French Pembroke. Great Cæsar! Haven’t I seen
your father carry everything before him just like
this! Would that he were alive this night! My
darling, you should have heard his speech&mdash;a regular
Burr and Blennerhassett speech, Olivia&mdash;and the
effect&mdash;by Jove, my dear, I can’t describe it&mdash;and
the Judge called him up on the bench to congratulate
him&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Colonel surged on, telling everything at
once. Olivia listened with shining eyes. She had
held out her hand to Pembroke in the beginning,
and as her father talked she continued to hold the
hand in her little strong clasp. For the first time
Pembroke was burnt by the fire in her eyes. What a
woman for a man full of ambition to have! He had
seen Elise Koller wildly enthusiastic about herself&mdash;but
Olivia had forgotten all about herself. She
was coloring, smiling, and sympathetic about him.</p>

<p>“How glad I am&mdash;how splendid of you&mdash;for that
poor negro, too. God will reward you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Now, my boy,” cried the Colonel, “What do you
want? Your dinner or your bed?”</p>

<p>“My bed,” answered Pembroke, smiling, but
ready to drop. “I want nothing but sleep, and I
want to sleep a week. Thank you, Olivia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>He had never called her by her name since they
were boy and girl together. The Colonel in his
excitement did not notice it, but Olivia turned a
beautiful rosy red. The Colonel dragged Pembroke
off to his room. Petrarch put him to bed. Before
he slept though, his thoughts returned to Olivia’s
soft eyes&mdash;while Colonel Berkeley, walking the
drawing-room floor downstairs, retailed in flamboyant
language, to Olivia, the triumphs of the day.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> took two or three days for Pembroke to
recover from his fatigue and excitement. Perhaps
he did not hasten his complete recuperation. It
was surely pleasanter to come down to a twelve
o’clock breakfast, served piping hot by Petrarch,
with Olivia to pour his coffee for him, with that
morning freshness which is so becoming to a
woman, than the loneliness of Malvern, with poor
Miles’ sad face and pathetic effort to forget himself
and the wreck of his boyish life. Cave had taken
the boy to his cabin in the pine woods to stay some
days, so that there was nothing to call Pembroke
back home. Miles was happier than for a long
time. Cave spoke to him with a certain bracing
encouragement that Olivia’s pitiful sympathy and
his brother’s sharp distress lacked. There was
more of the salt of common sense in what Cave
said than in Olivia’s unspoken consolation, which
much as it charmed the boy, sometimes left him
sadder than it found him. She was so sorry for
him that she could not always disguise it.</p>

<p>So a few days went on, and Pembroke began to
find Olivia every hour pleasanter, more winning&mdash;until
one night in his own room, after Olivia had
played to him half the evening and had read to him
the other half, he took himself to task. In the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
place, he did not want to marry at all then. He
had a great many things to do first. Then, there
was a serious obstacle in the way, even had all the
rest been smoothed out. The Pembroke fortune,
such as it was, was on its last legs. With the
negroes gone, and the land frightfully reduced in
value, there was only a slender competence left&mdash;and
those two years in Paris had cost a pretty
penny. Only during the last few weeks Pembroke
had waked up to the true condition of affairs. Miles
must be provided for, and upon a scale more suited
to Pembroke’s tastes than his resources. Then,
there remained for the elder brother, nothing. He
had not thought of this when he borrowed money
at a high interest so merrily while he was in Paris&mdash;but
as he was every day awaking to his manlier
self, this had come home to him in its true light.
He was not a man to ask any woman to share
poverty with him. To have brought a woman
down, as his wife, from a state of former luxury,
would have been a misery too keen. Rather would
he have died&mdash;for false as well as true pride had
great share in him. Therefore, he thought, as he
sat in his room smoking, it would be better that he
did not get his wings scorched. It was to his credit
that he did not allow any supposition that Olivia
cared for him to enter into his calculation.</p>

<p>“Sweet Olivia,” he thought to himself, “some
luckier man will win you. I shall be ten years too
late,”&mdash;and then he sighed, and presently began to
whistle cheerfully. But one thing was sure. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
would never marry Elise Koller. Even though his
eyes were opened now to the fact that he was virtually
a ruined man, there was no longer any chance
that the baser part of him would succumb to that
temptation.</p>

<p>It was pleasant&mdash;especially the Colonel’s jolly
company, to say nothing of Petrarch’s, who
highly approved of Pembroke, and remarked as he
industriously brushed his clothes on the last night,
“I clar, Marse French, you sutny do favor yo’
par. I ’member de time he made that argyument
when Marse Jack Thornton, he mos’ kilt Marse
Spott Randolph on ’count o’ Miss Tilly Corbin.
We had ole wuks dat time. ’Twuz when me an’
Marse was co’tin’ missis. I tell yo’ par, ‘A eye fur
a eye,’ ‘a toof fur a toof, an’ I will resist de cripplers,
say de Lord.’ Marster an’ me went to de
cote house ter hear him. I tho’t ’bout it de yether
night, when de white folks was a crowdin’ ’roun’
an’ shakin’ yo’ han’ an’ clappin’ you on de back.
Arter you went up st’yars, Miss Livy, she come an’
say to me, ‘Petrarch, did you hear de speech?’
I say, ‘Lord, honey, dat I did. You jes’ oughter
seen de folks whoopin’ an’ hollerin’ and Marse
French he stannin’ up, lookin’ handsome like he mar’&mdash;you
aint forgit yo’ mar, has you, Marse French?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Pembroke.</p>

<p>“I reklecks her when she warn’t no older ’n Miss
Livy. She was kinder light on her feet like Miss
Livy, and she had dem shinin’ eyes, an dat ar way
Miss Livy got o’ larfin’ at yer. She an’ mistis’ was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
mighty good frien’s, jes’ like you par an’ marse, an’
David an’ Jonadab. Dey use ter come here an’
stay a week&mdash;yo’ mar come in de kerridge wid Miss
’Lizbeth an’ Marse Miles, an’ yaller Betsy&mdash;she was
a likely nigger, but a dretful sinner,&mdash;an’ you on a
little pony ridin’ by yo’ par’s side. Lordy how you
did useter tease Miss Livy an’ dem chillen! Some
times you mek Miss Livy cry&mdash;an’ cry, an’ de tears
wuz like de waters o’ Babylon.”</p>

<p>“What a brute I must have been! Why didn’t
you or yellow Betsy get me a lathering?”</p>

<p>“Hi, Marse French, boys is boys. Dey c’yarn
help bein’ troublesome an’ dirty an’ teasin’. Gord
done made ’em so. ‘My people is rambunctious,’
He say, an’ I ain’t never seen no boys ’cept what
was dirty an’ tormentin’.”</p>

<p>At last, Pembroke felt he had no excuse for
remaining longer at Isleham, and besides, he was
seriously afraid of falling in love with Olivia. So
he took his way back to Malvern.</p>

<p>While at Isleham, he had got one or two cocked-hatted
notes from Madame Koller. But on reaching
home he found that one arrived with great regularity
every morning and occasionally during the
day beside. The tenor of all was the same. Why
did he not come to see his friend. She was so
lonely. The country was <i>triste</i> at best. Pembroke
felt very like asking her if the country was so triste
then why did she not go away. But he was a gentleman
as well as a man, and was patient with
women even in their follies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>At last, when he could put it off no longer&mdash;as
indeed he had no tangible reason for not going to see
Madame Koller&mdash;he went. She received him in her
little sitting-room, adapting at the time one of her
prettiest poses for his benefit. She had heard of his
triumph and was full of pretty congratulations&mdash;but
in some way, she could not strike the note of
praise that would harmonize. She didn’t know
anything about professional men. She had lived
in Europe long enough to get the notion that it
was rather vulgar to work for pay&mdash;not that Pembroke
got any pay in this case. But if Pembroke
had married her, that weather-beaten sign “Attorney-at-Law”
would have come down from his office
in the village, and the office itself would have lost
its tenant&mdash;so she thought.</p>

<p>Pembroke always felt a delicacy in asking her to
sing, but Madame Koller often volunteered to do
it, knowing Pembroke’s passionate fondness for
music, and feeling that truly on that ground they
were in sympathy. Olivia Berkeley’s finished and
charming playing pleased and soothed him, but it was
nothing to the deep delight that Madame Koller’s
music gave him&mdash;for when she sat down to the piano
and playing her own accompaniments sang to him
in her fervid way, it simply enchanted him&mdash;and
Madame Koller knew it. Although he was exasperatingly
cool under the whole battery of her smiles
and glances, yet when she sang to him, he abandoned
himself to the magic of a voice.</p>

<p>While she seated herself at the piano and began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
to sing, Pembroke, stretched out in a vast chair,
glanced sidewise at her. She did not mouth and
grimace in singing as many women do. She
opened her wide, handsome mouth, and seemed
only to be calmly smiling, while her voice soared
like a bird. She had, in short, no amateurish
tricks.</p>

<p>Her profile, with its masses of yellow hair, was
imposing. She was no mere slip of a girl. When
she had sung to him for the best part of an hour
she thought the time had come for her reward. So
she went back to her place on the sofa near the fire
and posed beautifully. Pembroke almost groaned.
The singing was delicious enough, but the sentimental
hair-splitting had long since palled&mdash;and
besides, the lady was too much in earnest.</p>

<p>“You remained several days, did you not, at the
Colonel’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Pembroke, cheerfully, and thinking
gloomily how very like a matrimonial lecture was
the ensuing conversation. These interviews with
Madame Koller always disinclined him extremely
to giving any woman the power to ask him searching
questions. Only, he did not believe Olivia
Berkeley was an inquisitive woman&mdash;she was quite
clever enough to find out what she wished to know
without asking questions.</p>

<p>The only remark Madame Koller made in reply
was, “Ah,”&mdash;and lapsed into silence, but the
silence did not last long.</p>

<p>“Olivia must have been very charming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“Immensely,” answered Pembroke, with much
heartiness, and wishing Madame Koller would sing
again. He hardly knew which was the more exasperating,
Madame Koller’s tone to him in speaking
of Olivia, or Olivia’s tone in speaking of Madame
Koller.</p>

<p>“Olivia is so excessively tame,” said she, after a
pause. “So cold&mdash;so self-contained.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think she lacks spirit, though,” responded
Pembroke, with the easy air of a man discussing
the most trivial subject, although he swore
mentally at Madame Koller for introducing the
subject. “Miss Berkeley has the reticence of a
gentlewoman. But by heaven! I wouldn’t like to
arouse that spirit of hers.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller sighed. It was a real and genuine
sigh. She was thinking how hard and strange
it was that she was not permitted by fate to be
either a complete gentlewoman or a complete
artist. She had learned in her student days, and
in that brief and brilliant artistic period, to be reticent
about her money matters, but that was all.
She saw even in her Aunt Sally Peyton, whom she
regarded as an interfering old person, without any
style whatever, a certain air of security in what she
said and did&mdash;a calm indifference to her world&mdash;that
Madame Koller was keen enough to know
marked the gentlewoman&mdash;which she, Elise Koller,
who had ten times the advantages, and had twenty
times the knowledge of the world that old Mrs.
Peyton had, was never quite sure&mdash;there just was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
a little uncertainty&mdash;ah, it was very little, but it
made a great deal of difference.</p>

<p>“America seems queer enough to me now,” she
said presently.</p>

<p>“Very likely,” answered Pembroke. “You have
remained here much longer already than I expected.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller at this fixed her eyes upon Pembroke
in a way that made him wince. A blush,
too, showed through his dark skin.</p>

<p>“Can you&mdash;can you&mdash;say <i>that</i> to me?” she cried.</p>

<p>Like any other man under the same circumstances,
Pembroke remained perfectly silent&mdash;because it
is a well-known fact that when a woman takes
the initiative in tender speeches, the man, if he be
a man, is at once silenced. But Madame Koller
was fluent.</p>

<p>“I know what you think of me,” she said. This
surprised Pembroke, who really did not know what
he thought of her. “You think me the weakest
woman in the world. But I have been strong.
While my husband lived, heaven knows what I endured.
He was the cruelest creature God ever
made.”</p>

<p>Pembroke thought it was the same old story of
continental husbands and wives. He had once
known a marchese who made no secret that he
occasionally beat his marchesa. But Madame Koller
almost made him smile at the grotesqueness of
what she told him, although it was real enough to
her to make her weep in the telling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“He was always ill&mdash;or imagining himself ill. He
took medicine until he nearly drove me crazy with
his bottles and plasters. He lived in a bath chair
when he was as well able to walk about as I was&mdash;and
I was chained to that bath chair. Everything
made him ill&mdash;even my singing. He would not let
me sing&mdash;only think of it&mdash;think of it.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller glanced at Pembroke through her
tears. He had stood up and was saying something
vague but comforting. The late Mr. Koller was
indeed a dreadful reminiscence.</p>

<p>“Banish that time as far as you can,” he said.
“The present is yours.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” she said. “Now I will say to you that
black as that past is, it is not so black as this present.
Now I endure torments far greater than any
I felt then.”</p>

<p>Pembroke’s strong jaw was set resolutely. He
felt rising tumultuously within him that masculine
pity that has wrecked many men. He would not,
if he could help it, prove false to himself with this
woman, in spite of her tears and her voice.</p>

<p>“What have you to say to me?” she demanded,
after a pause.</p>

<p>“This,” answered Pembroke, with much outward
boldness. “That your coming here is an unsuccessful
experiment. The same things that made
this country life distasteful to you in your childhood
even, make it distasteful now. This is not
your native atmosphere. You will never be anything
but morbid and wretched here. This country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
life is like death to you&mdash;and almost like death to
me.”</p>

<p>“Then why&mdash;why&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why do I stand it? Because I must. Because
as a man, I must. Here is my work, my
duty, my manhood. Don’t be surprised to hear
me talk this way. You haven’t heard me speak of
these things before&mdash;but still they govern me some&mdash;more
of late than they used to do. There is a
good deal here that is melancholy enough to me&mdash;but
I would be a poltroon if I started out to make
life amusing. You see, I have considerable ambition&mdash;and
that impels me to work.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller surveyed him keenly. By degrees
the fire of resentment rose in her eyes. She was
angered at his coolness, at his calm reasoning. Prudence
in love is commonly regarded as a beggarly
virtue by women.</p>

<p>“After all,” she said, “what are you to me?
Nothing but a whim, a caprice. But had you
spoken to me a year ago as you do now, I should
not be here.”</p>

<p>Pembroke remembered with a blush some slight
love-making episodes, and her tone stung him.</p>

<p>“I can play the rascal if you like,” he said,
angrily. “I can pretend to feel what I don’t feel,
but I warn you, I shan’t be a pleasant rascal. If
ever I take to villainy I shall probably take to drink
and gambling too.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller sat down discontentedly on the
sofa. When Pembroke had arrived that afternoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
her intention had been to determine one thing or
another&mdash;for life at The Beeches could not be
endured much longer. It mattered little what old
Madame Schmidt said, but her cousin, Ahlberg, was
getting restive and threatened to leave her&mdash;and
she was mortally afraid of being left in America
alone. But what progress had she made? None.
And suppose Pembroke were to leave that house
her lover, would it not be the greatest act of folly
she had ever committed?&mdash;and she had had her
follies. And so she was tossed hither and thither
by prudence and feeling, and condemning her own
weakness, yet tamely submitted to it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pembroke had decided for himself.
This thing could go on no longer. He felt at that
moment as if he had had enough of love-making to
last him for the next ten years. And besides, he
had withstood enough to make him feel that he
did not care to withstand any more. So he picked
up his hat with an air of great determination.</p>

<p>“I must leave you,” he said. “Elise, you have
given me many happy hours, but it would be ruin
for us to become either more or less than friends.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller had thought herself thoroughly
prepared for this, which her own sense told her
was literally true. But suddenly, without a moment’s
warning, without her own volition, and almost
without her knowledge, she burst into violent
weeping. Was it for this she had come the interminable
distance&mdash;that she had suffered horrors
of loneliness and ennui? Alas, for her!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>Pembroke was appalled. Apparently all was to
do over again, but there was no longer any room
for weakness. His mind was made up and could
not be unmade. He only stood silent, therefore,
biting his lip, while his face grew crimson.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life he hailed Ahlberg as
a relief&mdash;for at that moment Ahlberg appeared on
the threshold. Madame Koller pulled herself together
as quickly as she had given way.</p>

<p>“Ah, Louis, you are welcome. Do not go yet,”
to Pembroke.</p>

<p>Pembroke did not take the hint. He went immediately.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sudden pang which wrenched poor Mr.
Cole’s heart when he heard that Madame Koller
would soon leave the county, and the country as
well, was vain suffering. For Madame Koller did
not go. Old Madame Schmidt for the first time
became restless. Ahlberg protested that he could
not stay any longer. Pembroke had become entirely
at ease about Ahlberg. Apparently Ahlberg
was in no hurry to carry out that rash engagement
to fight, which Pembroke regarded on his own part
as a piece of consummate folly, and was heartily
ashamed of. He did not feel the slightest apprehension
that, if the truth got out, his personal
courage would be suspected, because that had been
tested during the war, but he was perfectly willing
to let Ahlberg’s arm take as long to recover as it
chose, and called himself a fool every time he
thought about the roadside quarrel.</p>

<p>The ennui was nearly killing to Madame Koller,
yet she stayed on under a variety of pretexts which
deceived everybody, including herself.</p>

<p>She was not well adapted for solitude, yet most
of the people about bored her. Mrs. Peyton, she
considered as her bête noir, and quite hated to see
the Peyton family carriage turning into the carriage
drive before the door. But for her singing she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
would have died. But just as long as the wheezy
old grand piano in the drawing-room would hold together,
she would not be quite friendless. Pembroke
had not been to see her since that afternoon when
she had wept so. But she conveyed to him one day
when she met him at Isleham, that he need not be
afraid to come to see her. Man like, Pembroke
could not resist this challenge, and went&mdash;and found
Madame Koller received him more like an ordinary
visitor than ever before. Consequently he went
again. Another motive which impelled him was
the talk that would arise in the county if he ceased
going to The Beeches at all. Everybody would
imagine there had been a breach, and if a breach, a
former friendship.</p>

<p>Cave, one day, met Madame Koller at Isleham.
When she told him of her loneliness he was stricken
with pity for not having been to see her. Like
Colonel Berkeley, he thought her presence in Virginia
was explained by money troubles, and asked
permission to visit her mother and herself, Madame
Schmidt being invariably brought in by Madame
Koller as if she were a real person instead of a mere
breathing automaton. And so he went.</p>

<p>“What a strange, fascinating man is your friend
Cave,” she said afterward to Pembroke upon one of
his occasional formal visits, when their conversation
was always upon perfectly safe and general subjects.</p>

<p>“I never discovered any strange fascination
about him,” laughed Pembroke with masculine
practicality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“He lives in the woods. Yet he understands art
better than any man I know.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing extraordinary. He is a highly
educated man. The doctors tell him he can’t live
except in the pine woods, but his two rooms in his
log cabin are more comfortable than any I have at
Malvern.”</p>

<p>“By the way, you have never invited me to Malvern.
I used to go there as a girl.”</p>

<p>Pembroke remembered a speech of his friend’s,
Mrs. Peyton, to him some time before.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear French,” she had said, “what a
dear, sweet, amiable creature your mother was&mdash;and
your father was a regular Trojan when he was
roused. I remember taking Eliza there for a visit
once, when she was growing up, and the singing
mania had just possessed her. She sung all day
and nearly all night&mdash;screech, screech&mdash;bang, bang
on the piano. Your father almost danced, he was
so mad&mdash;but your dear mother was all thoughtfulness.
‘My dear Sally,’ she would say every day
laughing. ‘Don’t feel badly about Eliza’s singing,
and the way Mr. Pembroke takes it. It is the only
chance John Cave has to say a word to Elizabeth.’
Your mother was highly in favor of that match, I
can tell you, though John had no great fortune&mdash;and
your father was so fond of him too, that he
really imagined John was courting him, instead of
Elizabeth. But I shortened my visit considerably,
I assure you.”</p>

<p>All this flashed through Pembroke’s mind when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Madame Koller spoke. And then he colored
slightly. He was a little ashamed of the dilapidation
of a once fine country house. During the
war, the place had been raided and the house fired.
The fire had been quickly extinguished, but the
front porch and a part of one wing was charred.
He felt some false, though natural shame at this,
particularly as Ahlberg, when he and Pembroke were
on visiting terms, had never been to the place without
intimating that it was queer they did not have
the house thoroughly rehabilitated. But Pembroke
had inherited a soul of Arab hospitality, and he
answered promptly:</p>

<p>“Whenever you and Madame Schmidt will honor
me with a visit, you will be most welcome.”</p>

<p>“And will you ask Mr. Cave, too?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Mr. Cave is my closest friend.”</p>

<p>Just as on a similar occasion, Colonel Berkeley
had incurred Olivia’s wrath by inviting the Pembrokes
to meet Madame Koller, so Miles, meaning
to do the most agreeable thing in the world,
informed Pembroke a day or two after he had mentioned
that Madame Koller and her mother and
Cave were coming to luncheon on Tuesday, that
meeting Colonel Berkeley, he, Miles, had invited
the Colonel and Olivia over for Tuesday, also&mdash;to
meet the others. Miles walked away, whistling to
his dog, serenely unconscious of the chagrin that
overwhelmed Pembroke at this apparently harmless

<p>Pembroke did not swear, although he was profane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
upon occasions&mdash;but when Aunt Keturah, his
old nurse and housekeeper, came to him the next
minute to ask something about the proposed festivity,
his answer was,</p>

<p>“Go to the devil!”</p>

<p>Aunt Keturah was naturally offended at this.</p>

<p>“I didn’t never think <i>my</i> mistis’ son gwin’ talk dat
discontemptuous way to de mammy dat nuss him and
Miss ’Lizbeth, and Marse Miles, an’ lay yo’ par out,
and your mar, an’ set by Miss ’Lizbeth an’ hole her
han’ ’twell de bref lef’ her body&mdash;” For your true
African never omits to mention any family tragedy
or sorrow or other lugubrious proceedings in which
he or she may have had a part.</p>

<p>“Well, old lady, I didn’t exactly mean what I
said&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, den, you hadn’t orter said nuttin’ like
it&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know it. If you were to go to the devil, I
don’t know what would become of me.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s so, honey. An’ ain’t no wife gwi’ do fur
you like yo’ po’ ole mammy”&mdash;for the possibility
of Pembroke’s marriage was extremely distasteful
to Keturah, as portending her downfall and surrender
of the keys.</p>

<p>Colonel Berkeley had often been to Malvern
since his return, but Olivia, not since she was a
child, when she would go over with her mother,
and played in the garden with Miles. Then Pembroke
was a tall, overbearing boy, a remorseless tease,
whose only redeeming trait, in her childish eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
was the wonderful stories he could tell out of
books&mdash;when he chose. Elizabeth she remembered&mdash;a
beautiful, haughty girl, who alternately
snubbed and petted her. It seemed so long ago.
They were to come to luncheon at two o’clock.
When Olivia and her father drove up, with Cave in
the carriage with them, whom they had picked up
on the road, Pembroke had been called off for a
moment by a client who was interviewing him in
“the office”&mdash;that necessary adjunct of every professional
man, and most of the gentry in Virginia, a
comfortable one or two-roomed building, a little
back of the “great house,” where the master kept
his books and accounts, his guns and hunting paraphernalia,
where his dogs had the right of entry
and his women kind had not.</p>

<p>The house had once been imposing. Two wings
rambled off from the center building. One was overgrown
with ivy, and looked both comfortable and
picturesque under the tall and branching elms. The
other was gaunt and scorched and weather-beaten.
The heat had cracked the windows and had forced
the bricks out of place. One pillar of the porch on
that side was gone. The damage to the house was
really not great, but apparently it was ruined.</p>

<p>Miles met them at the door&mdash;Miles, once the
handsome scapegrace, and now the blighted, the
unfortunate. The spectacle of his marred face was
in melancholy keeping with what surrounded him.</p>

<p>He was genuinely glad to see them. He came
down the steps, and gallantly and even with a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
grace, offered Olivia his one arm to alight from
the carriage. The Colonel scrambled out and immediately
seized Miles.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, driving through this plantation
to-day brought back to me your father’s purchase
of that woodland down by the creek in ’forty-six.”</p>

<p>Anything that occurred in ’forty-six had such a
charm for Colonel Berkeley that Miles knew he was
in for it. The Colonel took his arm and trotted up
and down the portico, pointing out various ways in
which the late Mr. Pembroke, his devoted friend,
had neglected the Colonel’s advice in regard to
farming, and the numberless evils that had resulted
therefrom. Colonel Berkeley entirely forgot that
his own farming was not above reproach, and if he
had been reduced to his land for a living, instead of
that lucky property at the North that he had so
strenuously tried to make way with, he would indeed
have been in a bad way. But the Colonel was
a famous farmer on paper, was president of the
Farmers’ Club of the county, had published several
pamphlets on subsoil drainage, and was a frequent
contributor to the columns of the Southern Planter
before the war.</p>

<p>Cave and Olivia, finding themselves temporarily
thrown on each other, concluded to walk through
the grounds. Madame Koller and her mother had
not yet arrived, and under the huge trees, a little
distance off, they could see Pembroke talking with
his visitor, as the latter mounted his horse to ride
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>In former days the grounds, like the house, had
been fine, but now they were completely overgrown
and neglected, yet, there was a kind of beauty in
their very wildness.</p>

<p>“How charming this wilderness of roses will be
when they are in bloom,” said Olivia, as they
walked through what had once been a rose walk,
stiff and prim, now rioting in lush luxuriance. “I
remember it quite straight, and the rose trees trimmed
up all in exactly the same shape&mdash;and see, the
roses have climbed so over the arbor that we can’t
get in.”</p>

<p>Cave said nothing. The one love of his life was
born and lived and died in this home. He could
see, through a rift in the trees, the brick wall around
the burying ground where Elizabeth lay. It was
fallen away in many places, and the sheep browsed
peacefully over the mounds. The marble slab over
Elizabeth was as yet new and white. Still Olivia
did not jar on him at that moment. She was innately
sympathetic.</p>

<p>They paced slowly about the graveled paths overgrown
in many places with weeds, and among a vigorous
growth of young shrubbery, unpruned and
unclipped. She pulled a great branch of pink dogwood
from a transplanted forest tree, and swayed
it thoughtfully as she walked. Presently they saw
Pembroke coming to look for them. As he approached
and took Olivia’s hand, a color as delicate
as that of the dogwood blossoms she held in
her other hand, mounted to her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>Then they turned back leisurely toward the
house. At one spot, under a great linden tree, was
the basin of a fountain, all yellow and choked with
the trailing arbutus, which grew with the wild profusion
that marks it in the depth of the woods.
The fountain was long since gone. Pembroke
plucked some of the arbutus and handed it to
Olivia, taking from her the dogwood branch at the
same time and throwing it away.</p>

<p>“The arbutus has a perfume&mdash;the dogwood has
none&mdash;and a flower without perfume is like a woman
without sentiment,” he said gayly. As they stood
still for a moment, Olivia suddenly exclaimed to
Pembroke:</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember something about this fountain&mdash;don’t
you?” Then they both began to laugh.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Cave.</p>

<p>“I was staying here once with mamma, when I
was a little girl&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I picked you up and held you over the basin to
scare you.”</p>

<p>“And dropped me in, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Went gallantly to the rescue and dragged you
out&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And your mother sent you to bed without your
dinner.”</p>

<p>“I remember thinking you were the most comical
looking object I ever saw with your curls dripping,
and I was particularly amused at the chattering
of your teeth. What remorseless wretches
boys are!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe you meant to let me slip.”</p>

<p>“You were splashing in the basin before I knew
it. But it seemed a delicious piece of mischief then,
and Miles’ terror that his turn would come next&mdash;Elizabeth
boxed my ears for it.”</p>

<p>For the first time since their return home each
came back to something like the old boy and girl
frankness, and they laughed like children.</p>

<p>“How I loved to come here when I was a little
girl. Your mother was certainly the most delightful
companion for a child. I remember how she
allowed me to brush her hair, it was so long and
beautiful. I suppose my efforts were torture to
her; how splendid she looked when she was dressed
for a ball.”</p>

<p>Pembroke was touched to the heart. His mother
who died like Elizabeth, in her youth and beauty,
was only seventeen years older than himself. He
remembered that she had been a little more than a
girl when he, her eldest son, reached up to her
shoulder. Olivia and her father were always associated
with his mother. Few persons remembered
her, he thought bitterly. He had imagined that it
was impossible for any one to know her without
being inspired with the profound admiration he felt,
along with his affection for her. But naturally it
was not so&mdash;and he felt an inexpressible pride in
hearing Olivia’s words. They were not many, but
he knew they came from her heart.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he said as they turned away
and pursued the path to the house while Cave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
dropped behind, “I think you are a little like my
mother. Petrarch says so too, and Petrarch is a
physiognomist.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” cried Olivia, nevertheless coloring
with pleasure. “Your mother was one of the most
beautiful women in the world, and most commanding
in her beauty. I don’t know anybody at all
like her.”</p>

<p>They were now near the house, and looking up,
Pembroke saw Madame Koller and the bundle
of wrappings she called mamma descending from
the carriage. A little unpleasant shock came upon
him. The ladies from The Beeches were out of
harmony just then.</p>

<p>Nevertheless they were very cordially greeted.
Although the day was spring-like, Madame Koller’s
gown was trimmed with fur, and she cowered close
to the fire in the big, draughty drawing-room. Pembroke
fancied that Madame Schmidt’s fondness for
wrappings would eventually descend to her daughter.
But Madame Koller was very handsome. The
quiet winter, the country air had made her much
younger and fresher. And then, most women are
much better looking when they are in love. They
live in a perpetual agitation, which gives a strange
brightness to the eye, a softness to the smile.
They are impelled toward their natural rôle, which
is acting. Madame Koller had the benefit of all
this.</p>

<p>The luncheon passed off very well. In the house
was that queer mixture of shabbiness and splendor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
common in Virginia country houses. At table
they sat in common Windsor chairs, but ate off
Sèvres china; a rickety sideboard was loaded down
with plate. The Virginians were, as a rule, indifferent
to comforts, but luxuries they must have.
After the luncheon Pembroke took them to the
library, and through such of the house as was
habitable. Madame Koller raved over the fine
editions of books, the old mahogany furniture, the
antique portraits intermingled with daubs of later
ancestors&mdash;the whole an epitome of the careless
pleasure-loving, disjointed life of the dead and
gone Virginia&mdash;when the people stocked their
cellars with the best wines and slept on husk mattresses&mdash;where
the most elaborate etiquette was
maintained in the midst of incongruities of living
most startling. It had never ceased to be puzzling
to Madame Koller. She admired, as well she
might, a lovely girlish portrait of Pembroke’s
mother which hung in the drawing-room. There
was a piteous likeness between it and the one
unscarred side of Miles’ face.</p>

<p>Miles had kept close to Olivia&mdash;he was not quite
easy with Madame Koller. As for Madame Schmidt,
he had in vain tried to get something out of her, but
the old lady was obviously so much more comfortable
seated by the drawing-room fire, well wrapped
up, with her feet on the footstool, and nobody to
distract her attention from keeping warm, that she
was considerately left to herself.</p>

<p>But Madame Koller did not enjoy the day, as,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
indeed, she did not at that phase of her existence
enjoy anything. She had fancied she could conquer
her heart, in the presence of its object, and
with a dangerous rival in the foreground. Love
finds a mighty helper in self-love. Whatever determination
she might once have had to relinquish
Pembroke melted away when she saw that Olivia
Berkeley and he were quietly slipping into a state
of feeling that would turn to something stronger
in a moment of time. And naturally she thought
no woman alive could withstand the man that had
conquered her.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the carriages
drove off. Olivia said truly she had had a very
happy day. Not so truly said Madame Koller.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter had lapsed into spring. It was April&mdash;the
May of colder climates. In a week&mdash;a day&mdash;Nature
had rushed into bloom. Even Madame Koller,
who cared little for these things, was awakened
to the beauty surrounding her. She spent hours
walking in the fresh morning air and thinking&mdash;thinking.
The few times she saw Pembroke, and the
quiet, formal courtesy with which he treated her was
as wind to flame. In his absence she was perpetually
thinking of him, devising wild and extravagant methods
of winning him. It was her pride, she now persuaded
herself, that needed to be avenged. Again
throwing prudence wildly aside, she boldly acknowledged
to herself that it was love. For the first time
in her life she was thrown upon herself&mdash;and a very
dangerous and undisciplined self it was. Sometimes
she blamed him less than he deserved for whatever
folly he had been a party to&mdash;and again she blamed
him more. Madame Koller was fast working herself
up to the point of an explosion.</p>

<p>Toward dusk one evening, as Olivia Berkeley
sat in the dim drawing-room where a little fire
crackled on the hearth, although the windows were
opened to the purple twilight outside, she heard
a light step upon the portico&mdash;and the next moment,
Madame Koller walked in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>Olivia received a kind of shock when she recognized
her. Madame Koller’s manner to her had
been queer of late, but she spoke to her very cordially.
Very likely she was wearied and ennuyéd
at home&mdash;and had to come to Olivia in the desperation
of loneliness.</p>

<p>Madame Koller, in response to Olivia’s hospitable
offer, allowed her to remove the long furred
mantle, and place it on a chair. She looked at
Olivia fixedly. Her eyes were large and very
bright.</p>

<p>“You are surprised that I should come here at
this time, Miss Berkeley?”</p>

<p>“I am very pleased, Madame Koller.”</p>

<p>“You are surprised. However, is it not strange
how in moments of great agitation, trifles will come
to one’s mind? It reminds me even now, how all
the people in this county are amazed at simple&mdash;very
simple things. There is nothing in my walking
a mile or two to see you&mdash;I have a servant outside&mdash;but
you, like the rest, regard it as very queer.”</p>

<p>“As you please, Madame Koller,” answered
Olivia.</p>

<p>“Still more strange will you think it when I tell
you my errand&mdash;for, although you are no fool,
Olivia Berkeley, you have no heart.”</p>

<p>“Did you take so much trouble in order to tell
me this to-night?” answered Olivia pleasantly
enough, but with that little shade of sarcasm in her
voice that is infuriating to people in deadly earnest.</p>

<p>“Not entirely. But I am glad you have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
heart to suffer. I would not wish any one to suffer
as I do.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller paused a moment.</p>

<p>“You know why I suffer. It is not my purpose
to say how much Pembroke is to blame. I do not
know how you cold, self-contained people consider
these things. He did not take the trouble to
undeceive me, when I supposed he loved me until
a few months ago&mdash;until you, in short, appeared.”</p>

<p>“Madame Koller,” said Olivia, haughtily, “may
I beg that you will not bring my name into your
personal affairs or Pembroke’s either? While I am
under no obligation to tell you, I have no hesitation
in saying that there is nothing whatever between
him and me that the whole world may not
know. He is not my lover and never has been.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller looked at Olivia and laughed
mirthlessly.</p>

<p>“You sit there and tell me that as coolly as if
you expected me to go home without saying another
word. But I will not go, and I will speak.
However, there is nothing that you need be angry
about. Only this. Pembroke, you see, is poor.
He has great gifts, but they will not bring him
money for many years. He is extravagant&mdash;he is
proud. He wants to go into public life&mdash;that he
has told me. Imagine the terrible future of poverty
and debt before him if he marries without a fortune.
I can save him from all this. I am rich enough
for both. Say that you will not stand in my way.
I will remove the only obstacle in his path. I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
give up everything. I will stay in this tedious
land for his sake. He shall pursue any career he
chooses. Think well what it is to rob such a man
of his only chance of fortune and ease. For if he
does not marry me, he will certainly marry you.”</p>

<p>Olivia sat upright in her chair completely dazed.
She forgot to be indignant. For the first time the
truth enunciated by Madame Koller came home to
her. Pembroke <i>was</i> poor. He <i>was</i> extravagant.
He <i>was</i> bent upon entering politics. Olivia had,
as most women, a practical sympathy. She knew
very well the horrors of poverty for such a man,
and her portion would be but small.</p>

<p>Madame Koller, seeing that she had made her
impression, waited&mdash;and after a while continued.
Her voice was low and very sweet. She seemed
pleading for Pembroke’s salvation.</p>

<p>“Pembroke, you know, is already deeply in debt.
He cannot readily accommodate himself to the
style of provincial living here. He would say all
these things are trifles. I tell you, Olivia Berkeley,
they are not trifles. They are second nature. Is
it not cruel of God to make us so dependent on
these wretched things? It was for these same
wretched things that I endured torture for years&mdash;for
money and clothes and carriages&mdash;just such
things as that.”</p>

<p>Olivia by a great effort recovered herself.</p>

<p>“What you say is true, Madame Koller. But I
will not&mdash;how can you ask me such things about a
man who has never&mdash;never”&mdash;she stopped at a loss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
to express her meaning, which implied a reproach
at Madame Koller’s want of delicacy.</p>

<p>Madame Koller made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>“What are promises?” she cried. “Nevertheless,
I want you to see that if you marry Pembroke
it will be his ruin. It would be most wicked selfishness.”</p>

<p>“Madame Koller,” answered Olivia, rising, “I
will not listen to any more.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing more to say,” responded Madame
Koller, rising too, and drawing her cloak
around her. “I did not expect more from you
than conventional tolerance. Had you a heart you
would have felt for me&mdash;for him&mdash;for yourself.
Can you conceive of anything more noble, or more
piteous than two women, one of whom must make
a great sacrifice for the man they both love&mdash;come,
you need not deny it, or lose your temper&mdash;because
I see you have a temper.” Olivia’s air and
manner did certainly indicate dangerous possibilities.
“I repeat, of two women as we are, the one
makes the sacrifice&mdash;the other feels it to the quick.
You talk though like a boarding-school miss. You
might have got all the phrases you have used out of
a book of deportment.”</p>

<p>“I am as sincere as you are, Madame Koller,”
answered Olivia, in a voice of restrained anger. “I
cannot help it that I am more reserved. I could no
more say what you have said&mdash;” here a deep flush
came into Olivia’s face&mdash;“than I could commit murder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>Madame Koller stood up, and as she did so, she
sighed deeply. Olivia, for the first time, felt sorry
for her.</p>

<p>“Women who love are foolish, desperate, suicidal&mdash;anything.
I do not think that you could ever
love.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that? I <i>know</i> better. I could love&mdash;but
not like&mdash;not like&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not like me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, since you have said it. Something&mdash;something&mdash;would
hold me back from what you speak of
so openly.”</p>

<p>“I always said you were as nearly without feeling
as the rest of the people here. Elizabeth Pembroke
is the only woman I know of, among all of
us, that ever really loved. But see how curious it
was with her. She defied her father’s curses&mdash;yet
she did not have the nerve to marry the man she
truly loved, because he happened to be an officer in
the Union army, for fear the Peytons and the Coles,
and the Lesters, and the rest of them, would have
turned their backs on her at church. Bah!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it was want of nerve on Elizabeth
Pembroke’s part,” replied Olivia. “She was not
born to be happy.”</p>

<p>“Nor was I,” cried Madame Koller, despondently.</p>

<p>There was no more said for a minute or two.
Then Madame Koller spoke again.</p>

<p>“Now you know what I feel. I don’t ask anything
for myself&mdash;I only wish to show you that
you will ruin Pembroke if you marry him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>An angry light came into Olivia’s eyes. She
stood up, straight and stern, and absolutely grew
taller as she looked fixedly at Madame Koller.</p>

<p>“This is intolerable,” she said. “There is nothing&mdash;absolutely
nothing&mdash;between Pembroke and
me, and yet I am subjected to this cross-questioning.”</p>

<p>“You would complain a great deal more of it if
there were anything between you,” answered
Madame Koller, not without a glimpse of grotesque
humor. “But now you know where I stand&mdash;and
let me tell you, Olivia Berkeley, Pembroke is not
guiltless toward me, however he would pretend it”&mdash;and
without waiting for the angry reply on Olivia’s
lips, she vanished through the open door.</p>

<p>All that evening, as Olivia sat with a book on
her lap, not reading, but watching the flame on the
broad hearth, she was turning over in her mind
what Madame Koller had said. It had disturbed
her very much. It had not raised Pembroke at
all in her esteem. She begun, nevertheless, to
think with pity over the wretchedness of his fate
should he be condemned to poverty. She fancied
him harassed by debts, by Miles’ helplessness. Her
tender heart filled with pity.</p>

<p>“Olivia, my love,” said the Colonel, emerging
from behind his newspaper for a moment. “Pembroke
means to try for the nomination to Congress&mdash;and
Cave tells me he is pretty sure to get it.
Great pity. A man who goes into public life without
out a competence dooms himself to a dog’s life for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the remainder of his days. It ruined Pembroke’s
father thirty years ago.”</p>

<p>Olivia started. This was like an oracle answering
her own thoughts.</p>

<p>She thought, with a little bitter smile that it did
not require much generosity to give up a man on
whom one had no claim, and laughed at the idea
of a struggle. At all events she would forget it
all. It was not so easy to forget though. The
thought stayed with her, and went to bed with her,
and rose with her next morning.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, alas, for Madame Koller. When she
came out, she looked around in vain for the negro
woman who had come with her. She was not to be
seen. They had come by the path that led through
the fields, which made it only a mile from The
Beeches to Isleham, but in going back, she missed
her way&mdash;and then being a little afraid of the negroes,
she went “around the road,” as they called it.
At the first gate, a man galloped out of the darkness.
It was Pembroke. He recognized her at once, and
got off his horse.</p>

<p>“You here,” he cried in surprise&mdash;“at this hour”&mdash;for
it was well on to seven o’clock, and Madame
Koller was not noted for her fondness for walking.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter at Isleham?” he asked&mdash;for
she could not have come from anywhere else.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” she replied nervously. “I&mdash;I&mdash;went
over to see Olivia Berkeley,” she added
boldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>Pembroke could say nothing. After a pause,
Madame Koller burst out.</p>

<p>“Pembroke, that girl is made of iron. She cares
nothing for you&mdash;for anybody but herself.”</p>

<p>“And did you find out any of those things by
asking her?” he inquired.</p>

<p>The twilight was so upon them that Madame
Koller could not well see Pembroke’s face, but she
realized the tone of suppressed rage in his voice.
She herself had a temper that was stormy, and it
flamed out at that tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, I asked her. Are you a man that you can
reproach me with it?”</p>

<p>It is difficult for a man, if he is a gentleman, to
express his wrath toward a woman. Pembroke
was infuriated at the idea that Madame Koller
should go to Olivia Berkeley and ask prying questions.
He ground his teeth with wrath as he
looked at Madame Koller standing before him, in
the half light.</p>

<p>“What a price I have had to pay for folly,” he
cried furiously. “A little damned love-making in a
garden&mdash;” he was so savage that he was not choice
of words and fell into profanity as men naturally
do&mdash;“a half dozen notes and bouquets&mdash;Great
God! Is there anything in that which should be a
curse to a man’s whole life! And I love Olivia
Berkeley. I could make her love me, but&mdash;but for
you.”</p>

<p>His violence sobered Madame Koller at once.</p>

<p>“There was not much, certainly,” she responded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
calmly. “The love-making in the garden and the
bouquets would have been little enough&mdash;but unfortunately
hearts are so perverse. A great many
are broken by such trifles. It was very amusing to
you but not so amusing altogether to me.”</p>

<p>Pembroke began to be ashamed of himself. But
he was still magnanimous enough not to tell her
that she had taken a queer course about those
things.</p>

<p>“I suppose I am to blame,” he said with sulky
rage after a moment. “I’m willing to shoulder all
the blame there is&mdash;but why should Olivia Berkeley
be insulted and annoyed by this kind of thing?
Do you think you will ever accomplish anything
by&mdash;” he stopped and blushed both for himself and
her.</p>

<p>“One thing is certain,” he continued. “After
what you have said to Olivia Berkeley, questioning
her about me, as you have admitted, I shall simply
carry out my intention of asking her to marry me.
She shall at least know the truth from me. But I
think my chances are desperate. Pshaw! I have
no chance at all. It’s rather grotesque, don’t you
think, for a man to ask a woman to marry him when
he knows that she will throw him over and despise
him from the bottom of her heart?”</p>

<p>“That I must decline to discuss with you,” quietly
answered Madam Koller. She was indeed quiet,
for at last&mdash;and in an instant, she realized that she
must forever give up Pembroke. All that long
journey was for nothing&mdash;all those months of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
wretched loneliness, of still more wretched hopes
and fears, were in vain. She heard Pembroke
saying:</p>

<p>“You had best let me see you home. It is too
late for you to be out alone.”</p>

<p>“You will not,” she replied. “I will not permit
you, after what you have said, to go one step
with me.”</p>

<p>Pembroke felt thoroughly ashamed. It was one
of the incidents of his association with Madame
Koller and Ahlberg that they always made him
say and do things he was ashamed of. In short,
they demoralized him. He had been betrayed
by temper and by circumstances into things
that were utterly against his self-respect&mdash;like
this ebullition of rage against a woman. In the
plenitude of his remorse he was humble to the last
degree.</p>

<p>“May I,” he asked&mdash;“may I, at least accompany
you to your own grounds? It is really not safe for
you.”</p>

<p>Madame Koller turned upon him and stamped
her foot.</p>

<p>“No, no&mdash;always no. Do you think there is
any danger on earth from which I would accept
your protection? Go to Olivia Berkeley. She
would marry you in your poverty if it suited her
whim, and be a millstone around your neck. Go
to her, I say.”</p>

<p>Pembroke watched her figure disappearing in the
dusk along the faint white line of the road. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
stood still with his horse’s bridle in his hand, turning
over bitter things in his mind. He thought he
would not go to Isleham that night. He was
depressed and conscience-stricken, and in no lover-like
mood. He mounted his horse and rode slowly
back to Malvern.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> two weeks had passed, Pembroke still had
not gone to Isleham&mdash;but in that time much had
happened. The congressional convention had been
held, and the ball had been opened for him by Cave
with great brilliancy and power&mdash;and after a hard
fight of two days, Pembroke had got the nomination
for Congress. It was of infinite satisfaction to
him in many ways. First because of the honor,
which he honestly coveted&mdash;and again because of
the ready money his election would bring. Modest
as a congressional salary would be, it was at least
in cash&mdash;and that was what he most needed then.
He did not have a walk over. The parties were
about evenly divided, and it was known that the
canvass would be close and exciting. Pembroke
warmed to his work when he knew this. It was
like Bob Henry’s trial&mdash;it took hold of his intellectual
nature. He was called magnetic&mdash;and he had
a nerve power, a certain originality about him that
captivated his audiences.</p>

<p>There is nothing that a mixed crowd of whites
and blacks at the South so much hates as a demagogue.
Especially is this the case with the “poor
whites” and the negroes. It was from them that
Pembroke knew he must get the votes to elect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
When he appeared on the hustings, he was the
same easy, gentlemanly fellow as in a drawing-room.
He slapped no man on the back, nor offered treats,
nor was there any change in his manner. He was
naturally affable, and he made it his object to win
the good will of his hearers through their enlightenment,
not their prejudices. The Bob Henry episode
did him immense service. A great revolution had
taken place in regard to Bob Henry. As, when he
had been poor and in prison and friendless and suspected,
everybody had been down on him, so now
when he was free and cleared of suspicion, and had
been an object of public attention, he became something
of a hero. He worked like a beaver among
his own people for “Marse French.” At “night
meetings” and such, he was powerful&mdash;and in the
pulpits of the colored people, the fiat went forth
that it “warn’t wuff while fer cullud folks to pay
de capilation tax fer to git young Mr. Hibbs, who
warn’ no quality nohow” into Congress&mdash;for the
redoubtable Hibbs was Pembroke’s opponent.
This too, had its favorable action on his canvass.
As for Petrarch, he claimed a direct commission
from the Lord to send “Marse French ter Congriss.
De Lord, de Great Physicianer, done spoken it ter
me in de middle o’ de night like he did ter little
Samson, sayin’ ‘Petrarch whar is you?’ He say
‘What fur I gin you good thinkin’ facticals, ’cep’
fur ter do my will? An’ it ain’t Gord’s will dat no
red headed Hibbs be ’lected over ole Marse French
Pembroke’s son, dat allus treated me wid de greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
circumlocution.” Petrarch’s oratory was not
without its effect.</p>

<p>Pembroke’s natural gift of oratory had been revealed
to him at the time of Bob Henry’s acquittal.
He cultivated it earnestly, avoiding hyperbole and
exaggeration. There is nothing a Virginian loves
so well as a good talker. Within ten days of the
opening of the campaign, Pembroke knew that he
was going to win. Hibbs had a very bad war record.
Pembroke had a very good one. The canvass
therefore to him, was pleasant, exciting, and with
but little risk.</p>

<p>But Olivia Berkeley’s place had not been usurped.
He had not meant or desired to fall in love. As
he had said truly to Cave, there were other things
for him than marriage. But love had stolen a
march upon him. When he found it out, he
accepted the result with great good humor&mdash;and he
had enough masculine self-love to have good hopes
of winning her until&mdash;until Madame Koller had put
her oar in. But even then, his case did not seem
hopeless, after the first burst of rage and chagrin.</p>

<p>She would not surrender at once&mdash;that he felt
sure, and he rather liked the prospect of a siege,
thinking to conquer her proud spirit by a bold
stroke at last. But Madame Koller had changed
all this. He was determined to make Olivia Berkeley
know how things stood between Madame Koller
and himself&mdash;and the best way to do it was to
tell her where his heart was really bestowed.</p>

<p>It was in the latter part of April before a day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
came that he could really call his own. He walked
over from Malvern late in the afternoon, and found
Olivia, as he thought he should, in the garden.
The walks were trimmed up, and the flower-beds
planted. Olivia, in a straw hat and wearing a
great gardening apron full of pockets, gravely
removed her gloves, her apron, and rolled them up
before offering to shake hands with Pembroke.</p>

<p>“Allow me to congratulate our standard-bearer,
and to apologize for my rustic occupations while
receiving so distinguished a visitor.”</p>

<p>Pembroke looked rather solemn. He was not in
a trifling mood that afternoon, and he thought
Olivia deficient in perception not to see at once
that he had come on a lover’s errand.</p>

<p>Is there anything more charming than an old-fashioned
garden in the spring? The lilac bushes
were hanging with purple blossoms, and great syringa
trees were brave in their white glory. The
guelder roses nodded on their tall stems, and a few
late violets scented the air. It was a very quiet
garden, and the shrubbery cut it off like a hermitage.
Pembroke had selected his ground well.</p>

<p>Olivia soon saw that something was on his mind,
but she did not suspect what it was. She had
heard that Madame Koller was to leave the country,
and she thought perhaps Pembroke needed
consolation. Men often go to one woman to be
consoled for the perfidy of another. Presently as
they strolled along, she stooped down, and plucked
some violets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“I thought they were quite gone,” she said.
“Here are four,” and as she held them out to Pembroke,
he took her little hand, inclosing the violets
in his own strong grasp.</p>

<p>There was the time, the place, the opportunity,
and Olivia was more than half won. Yet, half an
hour afterward, Pembroke came out of the garden,
looking black as a thunder-cloud, and strode away
down by the path through the fields&mdash;a rejected
suitor. Olivia remained in the garden. The cool
spring night came on apace. She could not have
described her own emotions to have saved her life&mdash;or
what exactly led up to that angry parting&mdash;for
it will have been seen before this that Pembroke
was subject to sudden gusts of temper. She had
tried to put before him what she felt herself obliged
in honor to say&mdash;that the Colonel’s modest fortune
was very much exaggerated&mdash;and she had blundered
wretchedly in so doing. Pembroke had rashly
assumed that she meant his poverty stood in the
way. Then he had as wretchedly blundered about
Madame Koller, and a few cutting words on both
sides had made it impossible for either to say more.
Olivia, pale and red by turns, looked inexpressibly
haughty when Madame Koller’s name was mentioned.
Lovers’ quarrels are proverbially of easy
arrangement&mdash;but the case is different when the
woman is high strung and the man high tempered.
Olivia received Pembroke’s confession with such
cool questionings that his self-love was cruelly
wounded. Pembroke took his dismissal so debonairly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
that Olivia was irresistibly impelled to make
it stronger. The love scene, which really began very
prettily, absolutely degenerated into a quarrel.
Pembroke openly accused Olivia of being mercenary.
Olivia retaliated by an exasperating remark,
implying that perhaps Madame Koller’s fortune
was not without its charm for him&mdash;to which Pembroke,
being entirely innocent, responded with a rude
violence that made Olivia more furiously angry than
she ever expected to be in her life. Pembroke seeing
this in her pale face and blazing eyes, stalked
down the garden path, wroth with her and wroth
with the whole world.</p>

<p>He, walking fast back through the woods, was
filled with rage and remorse&mdash;chiefly with rage.
She was a cold-blooded creature&mdash;how she did weigh
that money question&mdash;but&mdash;ah, she had a spirit of
her own&mdash;such a spirit as a man might well feel
proud to conquer&mdash;and the touch of her warm, soft
hand!</p>

<p>Olivia felt that gap, that chasm in existence, when
a shadowy array of vague hopes and fears suddenly
falls to the ground. Pembroke had been certainly
too confident and much too overbearing&mdash;but&mdash;it
was over. When this thought struck her, she was
walking slowly down the broad box-bordered walk
to the gate. The young April moon was just
appearing in the evening sky. She stopped suddenly
and stood still. The force of her own words
to him smote her. He would certainly never come
back. She turned and flew swiftly back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
upper part of the garden, and stood in the very
spot by the lilac hedge, and went over it all in her
mind. Yes. It was then over for good&mdash;and he
probably would not marry for a long, long time. She
remembered having heard Cave and her father speak
of Pembroke’s half joking aversion to matrimony.
It would be much better for him if he did not, as
he had made up his mind to enter for a career. But
strange to say this did not warm her heart, which
felt as heavy as a stone.</p>

<p>Presently she went into the house, and was quite
affectionate and gay with her father, playing the
piano and reading to him.</p>

<p>“Fathers are the pleasantest relations in the
world,” she said, as she kissed him good-night,
earlier in the evening than usual. “No fallings out&mdash;no
misunderstandings&mdash;perfect constancy. Papa,
I wouldn’t give you up for any man in the world.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you, my dear?” remarked that amiable
old cynic incredulously.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the drawbacks of Arcadia is that everybody
knows everybody else’s business&mdash;and the possibility
of this added to Pembroke’s extreme mortification.
He thought with dread of the Colonel’s
elaborate pretense of knowing nothing whatever
about the affair, Mrs. Peyton’s sly rallying, Mr.
Cole’s sentimental condolence&mdash;it was all very
exasperating. But solely to Olivia’s tact and good
sense both escaped this. Not one soul was the
wiser. Olivia, however she felt, and however skillfully
she might avoid meeting Pembroke alone, was
apparently so easy, so natural and self-possessed,
that it put Pembroke on his mettle. Together they
managed to hoodwink the whole county about their
private affairs&mdash;even Colonel Berkeley, who, if he
suspected anything, was afraid to let on, and Miles,
whose devotion to Olivia became stronger every day.</p>

<p>Luckily for Pembroke, he could plunge into the
heat of his canvass. After he had lost Olivia, the
conviction of her value came to him with overpowering
force. There was no girl like her. She did
not protest and talk about her emotions and analyze
them as some women did&mdash;Madame Koller, for
example&mdash;but Pembroke knew there was “more to
her,” as Cave said, “than a dozen Eliza Peytons.”
Perhaps Cave suspected something, but Pembroke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
knew he had nothing to fear from his friend’s manly
reticence. But to have lost Olivia Berkeley! Pembroke
sometimes wondered at himself&mdash;at the way
in which this loss grew upon him, instead of diminishing
with time, as the case usually is with disappointments.
Yet all this time he was riding from
place to place, speaking, corresponding, as eager to
win his election as if he were the happiest of
accepted lovers&mdash;more so, in fact.</p>

<p>And then, there was that Ahlberg affair to
trouble him. Like all the men of his race and generation,
he firmly believed there were some cases in
which blood must be shed&mdash;but a roadside quarrel,
in which nothing but personal dislike figured, did
not come under that head. Pembroke was fully
alive to the folly and wickedness of fighting Ahlberg
under the circumstances&mdash;but it was now impossible
for him to recede. He could only hope
and pray that something would turn up to prevent
a meeting so indefinitely fixed. But if Ahlberg’s
going away were the only thing to count upon,
that seemed far enough out of the question, for he
stayed on and on at the village tavern, playing
cards with young Hibbs and one or two frequenters
of the place, riding over to play Madame Koller’s
accompaniments, fishing for invitations to
dine at Isleham&mdash;in short, doing everything that a
man of his nature and education could do to kill
time. Pembroke could not but think that Ahlberg’s
persistence could only mean that he was really and
truly waiting for his revenge. So there were a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
good many things to trouble the “white man’s
candidate,” who was to make such a thorough and
brilliant canvass, and whose readiness, cheerfulness
and indomitable spirit was everywhere remarked
upon.</p>

<p>One night, as Pembroke was riding home after a
hard day’s work in the upper part of the county,
and was just entering the long straggling village
street, his horse began to limp painfully. Pembroke
dismounted, and found his trusty sorrel had cast a
shoe,&mdash;a nail had entered his foot, and there was a
job for the blacksmith. He led the horse to the
blacksmith’s shop, which was still open, although it
was past seven o’clock, and on the promise of having
the damage repaired in half an hour, walked
over to the village tavern.</p>

<p>It was in September, and the air was chilly. The
landlord ushered him into what was called the
“card room”&mdash;the only place there was a fire. A
cheery blaze leaped up the wide old-fashioned chimney,
and by the light of kerosene lamps, Pembroke
saw a card party at a round table in the corner. It
was Ahlberg, young Hibbs, his political opponent,
and two or three other idle young men of the
county.</p>

<p>According to the provincial etiquette, Pembroke
was invited to join the game, which he courteously
declined on the ground that he was much fatigued
and was only waiting for the blacksmith to put his
horse’s shoe on before starting for home. The
game then proceeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>Pembroke felt awkward and ill at ease. He
knew he was in the way, as the loud laughter from
Hibbs and his friends, and Ahlberg’s subdued
chuckle had ceased when he came in. They played
seriously&mdash;it was écarté, a game that Ahlberg had
just taught his postulants. Young Hibbs had a
huge roll of bills on the table before him, which he
somewhat ostentatiously displayed in the presence
of his opponent, whose lack of bills was notorious.
Also, Pembroke felt that his presence induced
young Hibbs to bet more recklessly than ever, as a
kind of bravado&mdash;and Ahlberg always won, when
the stake was worth any thing.</p>

<p>The waiting seemed interminable to Pembroke
seated in front of the fire. The conversation
related solely to the game. Presently Pembroke
started slightly. Ahlberg was giving them some
general views on the subject of écarté. Pembroke
himself was a good player, and he had never heard
this scheme of playing advocated.</p>

<p>Over the mantel was an old-fashioned mirror,
tilted forward. Although his back was to the
players, Pembroke could see every motion
reflected in the glass. He saw Hibbs lose three
times running in fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Pembroke’s sight was keen. He fixed it on the
glass and a curious look came into his dark face.
Once he made a slight movement as if to rise, but
sat still. A second time he half rose and sat down
again&mdash;nobody in the room had seen the motion.
Then, without the slightest warning, he suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
took three strides over to the card table and, reaching
over, seized Ahlberg by the collar, and lifted
him bodily up from the table into a standing position.</p>

<p>“Produce that king of spades,” he said.</p>

<p>If he had shot Ahlberg no greater surprise could
have been created. Hibbs jumped up, dashing the
cards and money in a heap on the floor, and nearly
upsetting the table. One of his companions
grabbed the lamp to save it.</p>

<p>Ahlberg turned a deathly color, and made some
inarticulate effort to be heard, and tried to wrest
himself from Pembroke’s grasp. But it was in
vain. Pembroke shook him slightly, but never relaxed
his hold.</p>

<p>“The king of spades, I say.”</p>

<p>Without a word Ahlberg reached down, and
from some unknown depths produced the card.
He was no coward, but he was overmastered physically
and mentally. He knew in an instant that
Pembroke had seen it all, and there was no shadow
of escape for him.</p>

<p>Pembroke let go of Ahlberg’s collar, and, taking
out a white handkerchief, wiped his hands carefully.
Ahlberg had sunk back, panting, in a chair.
The grip of a hand like Pembroke’s in the neighborhood
of the wind-pipe is calculated to shorten
the breath.</p>

<p>Hibbs looked dazed, from one to the other, and
then to the floor, where the cards had fallen. The
one damning card lay on the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“I saw it twice before this, in the glass,” said
Pembroke to Hibbs. “Each time I tried to catch
him, but he did it so well I couldn’t. But the last
time it was perfectly plain,&mdash;you see. I could see
under the table in the glass. You had better pick
up your money, Hibbs.”</p>

<p>At this, Ahlberg spoke up.</p>

<p>“All of it is Monsieur Hibbs’,” he said with
elaborate politeness, recovering his breath a little,
“except two fifty-dollar notes, which are mine.”</p>

<p>Pembroke picked out the two fifty-dollar notes
and dashed them in Ahlberg’s face, who very
cleverly caught them and put them in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pembroke,” said Hibbs, stammering and
blushing, “I&mdash;I&mdash;hope you won’t say anything
about this, sir. It would ruin me&mdash;I don’t mean
in the canvass, for I tell you truly, sir, I hope
you’ll be elected, and if it wasn’t for the party, I’d
give up the fight now. But my mother, sir, don’t
approve&mdash;don’t approve of playing for money&mdash;and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are perfectly safe,” answered Pembroke,
“and quite right in your idea of duty to your
party, and your dislike to wound your mother is
creditable. But as for this dog, he must leave this
county at once.”</p>

<p>Ahlberg said not a word. He did not lack mere
physical courage, but cheating at cards was, to him,
the most heinous offense of which he could be
convicted. He had been caught&mdash;it was the fortune
of war&mdash;there was nothing to be said or done.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
At least, it happened in this out-of-the-way corner
of the world, where it could never be known to
anybody&mdash;for he did not count his acquaintances
in the country as anybody, unless&mdash;perhaps&mdash;Madame
Koller. At that he grew pale for the first
time. He really wanted Madame Koller’s money.
But, in fact, he was somewhat dazed by Pembroke’s
way of settling the trouble. It really shocked his
ethics to see one gentleman punish another as if he
were a bargeman or a coal heaver. These extraordinary
Anglo-Saxons! But one thing was plain
with him&mdash;if he did not remain perfectly quiescent
Pembroke was quite capable of throwing him
bodily out of the window&mdash;and if he had lost his
honor, as he called it, there was no reason why he
shouldn’t save his bones.</p>

<p>Pembroke, however, although he would have
sworn that nothing Ahlberg could do in the way
of rascality could surprise him, was as yet amazed,
astounded, and almost puzzled by the promptness
with which Ahlberg acquiesced in the status which
Pembroke established. Ahlberg made no protest
of innocence&mdash;he did not bluster, or grow desperate,
or break down hysterically, as even a very bad
man might under the circumstances. He simply
saw that if he said anything, he might feel the
weight of Pembroke’s arm. Nothing that he could
have said or done was as convincing of his thorough
moral obtuseness as the way in which he accepted
his own exposure.</p>

<p>Just then the landlord opened the door. “Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
Pembroke, your horse is at the door. It’s going to
be a mighty bad night though&mdash;there’s a cloud
coming up. You’d better stay and join them gentlemen
in their game.”</p>

<p>“No, I thank you,” replied Pembroke, and turning
to Ahlberg. “Of course, after what has passed,
it is out of the question that I should fight you.
Good God! I’d just as soon think of fighting a
jail bird! Don’t take too long to get out of this
county. Good night, Mr. Hibbs&mdash;good night&mdash;good
night.”</p>

<p>Hibbs accompanied him out, and stood by him
while he mounted.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pembroke,” he said, holding his hat in his
hand, “I’m very much obliged for what you have
done for me, and what you have promised. I
promise you I’ll never touch a card for money
again as long as I live.”</p>

<p>“And don’t touch a card at all with such an infernal
rascal as Ahlberg,” answered Pembroke, altogether
forgetting sundry agreeable games he had
enjoyed with Ahlberg in Paris, and even in that
very county&mdash;but it had been a good while ago,
and Ahlberg had not tried any tricks on him.</p>

<p>This relieved Pembroke of a load of care&mdash;the
folly of that quarrel was luckily escaped. But he
debated seriously with himself whether he ought
not to tell Madame Koller of Ahlberg’s behavior,
that she might be on her guard against him. In a
day or two he heard, what did not surprise him,
that Ahlberg was about to leave the country&mdash;but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
at the same time that Madame Koller and her
mother were to leave The Beeches rather suddenly.
Mrs. Peyton met him in the road, and stopped her
carriage to tell him about Eliza Peyton’s consummate
folly in allowing that Ahlberg to stick to her
like a burr&mdash;they actually intended crossing in the
same steamer. That determined Pembroke. He
rode over to The Beeches, and sitting face to face
with Madame Koller in her drawing-room, told her
the whole story. Pembroke was somewhat shocked
to observe how little she seemed shocked at Ahlberg’s
conduct. It was certainly very bad, but&mdash;but&mdash;she
had known him for so long. Pembroke
was amazed and disgusted. As he was going, after
a brief and very business-like visit, Madame Koller
remarked, “And it is so strange about Louis.
The very day after it happened, he was notified of
his appointment as First Secretary in the Russian
diplomatic service&mdash;or rather his re-appointment,
for he was in it ten years&mdash;and he has come into
an excellent property&mdash;quite a fortune in fact for a
first secretary.” Pembroke rode back home slowly
and thoughtfully. He had never before realized
how totally wanting Madame Koller was in integrity
of mind. Olivia Berkeley now&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> takes a long time for a country neighborhood
to recover from a sensation. Three or four years
after Madame Koller, or Eliza Peyton had disappeared
along with her mother and Ahlberg, people
were still discussing her wonderful ways. Mr. Cole
was paying his court mildly to Olivia Berkeley,
but in his heart of hearts he had not forgotten
his blonde enslaver. The Colonel was the same
Colonel&mdash;his shirt-ruffle rushed out of his bosom as
impetuously as of old. He continued to hate the
Hibbses. Dashaway had been turned out to grass,
but another screw continued to carry the Colonel’s
colors to defeat on the county race track. Olivia,
too, had grown older, and a great deal prettier. A
chisel called the emotions, is always at work upon
the human countenance&mdash;a face naturally humane
and expressive grows more so, year by year.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that she was very happy
in that time. Life in the country, varied by short
visits to watering places in the summer and occasionally
to cities in the winter, is dull at best for a
girl grown up in the whirl of civilization. There
came a time&mdash;after Pembroke, taking Miles with
him had gone to Washington, when life began to
look very black to Olivia Berkeley’s eyes. She
suffered for want of an object in life. She loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
her father very much, but that cheerful, healthful
and robustious old person hardly supplied the
craving to love and tend which is innate in every
woman’s heart. It is at this point in their development
that women of inferior nature begin to deteriorate.
Not so with Olivia Berkeley. Life puzzled
and displeased her. She found herself full of
energy, with many gifts and accomplishments, condemned
in the flower of her youth to the dull routine
of a provincial life in the country. She could
not understand it&mdash;neither could she sit down in
hopeless resignation and accept it. She bestirred
herself. Books there were in plenty at Isleham&mdash;the
piano was an inestimable comforter. She
weathered the storm of ennui in this manner, and
came to possess a certain content&mdash;to control the
outward signs of inward restlessness. Meanwhile
she read and studied feverishly, foolishly imagining
that knowing a great number of facts would make
her happy. Of course it did not&mdash;but it made her
less unhappy.</p>

<p>As for Pembroke, the fate which had fallen hard
on Olivia Berkeley had fondly favored him. He
was not only elected to Congress, but he became
something of a man after he got there. The
House of Representatives is a peculiar body&mdash;peculiarly
unfavorable to age, and peculiarly favorable
to youth. Pembroke, still smarting under his
mortification, concluded to dismiss thoughts of any
woman from his mind for the present, and devote
himself to the work before him. With that view,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
he scanned closely his environment when he went
to Washington. He saw that as a young member
he was not expected to say anything. This left
him more leisure to study his duties. He aspired
to be a lawyer&mdash;always a lawyer. He found himself
appointed to a committee&mdash;and his fellow
members on it very soon found that the quiet
young man from Virginia was liable to be well informed
on the legal questions which the House and
the committees are constantly wrangling over.
Every man on that committee became convinced
that the quiet young man would some day make
his mark. This was enough to give him a good
footing in the House. His colleagues saw that
election after election, the young man was returned,
apparently without effort on his part, for Pembroke
was not a demagogue, and nothing on earth would
have induced him to go into a rough and tumble
election campaign. At last it got so that on the
few occasions when he rose in his place, he had no
trouble in catching the Speaker’s eye. He was wise
enough not to be betrayed by his gift of oratory into
speech-making&mdash;a thing the House will not tolerate
from a young member. He had naturally a beautiful
and penetrating voice and much grace and dignity
in speaking. These were enough without risking
making himself ridiculous by a premature
display as an orator. He sometimes thrilled when
the great battles were being fought before his eyes&mdash;it
was in the reconstruction time&mdash;and longed for
the day which he felt would come when he might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
go down among the captains and the shouting, but
he had the genius of waiting. Then he was a
pleasant man at dinner&mdash;and his four years army
service had given him a soldierly frankness and
directness. He lived with Miles in a simple and
quiet way in Washington. He did not go out
much, as indeed he had no time. He became quite
cynical to himself about women. The pretty girls
from New York were quite captivated with the
young man from Virginia. They wanted to know
all about his lovely old place, especially one charming
bud, Miss de Peyster.</p>

<p>“Come and see it,” Pembroke would answer
good-naturedly. “Half the house was burned up
by our friends, the enemy&mdash;the other half is habitable.”</p>

<p>“And haven’t you miles and miles of fields and
forests, like an English nobleman?” the gay creature
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes. Miles and miles. The taxes eat up
the crops, and the crops eat up the land.”</p>

<p>“How nice,” cried the daughter of the Knickerbockers.
“How much more romantic it is to have
a broken down old family mansion and thousands
of acres of land, than to be a stockbroker or a real
estate man&mdash;and then to have gone through the
whole war&mdash;and to have been promoted on the
field&mdash;”</p>

<p>Pembroke smiled rather dolefully. His ruined
home, his mortgaged acres, Miles’ life-long trouble,
his four years of marching and starving and fighting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
did not appear like romantic incidents in life,
but as cruel blows of fate to him.</p>

<p>But Helena de Peyster was a pleasant girl, and
her mother was gentle, amiable, and well-bred.
They had one of the gayest and most charming
houses in Washington, and entertained half the diplomatic
corps at dinner during every week. They
would gladly have had Pembroke oftener. He
came in to quiet dinners with them, assumed a
fatherly air with Helena, and liked them cordially.
They were good to Miles too, who sometimes went
to them timidly on rainy afternoons when he
would not be likely to find anybody else.</p>

<p>So went the world with Pembroke for some years
until one evening, going to his modest lodgings, he
found a letter with Colonel Berkeley’s big red seal
on it awaiting him.</p>

<p>He and Miles dined&mdash;then Pembroke, over the
wine, opened the Colonel’s billet. It was brief.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Boy</span>,&mdash;Olivia and I are coming to
Washington to spend the winter. I have not been
to the cursed town since the winter before the war,
when Wigfall was in the Senate, and Floyd was
Secretary of War. John B. Floyd was one of the
greatest men the State of Virginia ever produced.
Now, I want to go to a decent tavern&mdash;but Olivia,
who is a girl of spirit, won’t do it. She insists on
having a furnished house, and I’ve engaged one
through an agent. Don’t suppose it will suit, but
Olivia swears it will. We’ll be up in the course of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
a week or two, and will let you know. Damme
if I expect to find a gentleman in public life&mdash;always
excepting yourself, my dear boy. I inclose
you our address. Olivia desires her regards to you
and her particular love to Miles, also mine.</p>

<p class="right2">“Sincerely, your friend,</p>
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Th. Berkeley.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“That’s pleasant news,” said Miles.</p>

<p>“Very pleasant,” replied Pembroke, without
smiling in the least. He was glad to see the Colonel,
but he was still sore about Olivia. Whenever
he had been at home, the same friendly intercourse
had gone on as before&mdash;but there was always an
invisible restraint between them. Colonel Berkeley
had noticed it, and at last ventured to question
Olivia about it&mdash;when that young woman had
turned on her father and cowed him by a look of
her eye. There were some liberties the Colonel
could not take with his daughter.</p>

<p>Promptly, the Colonel and Olivia arrived.</p>

<p>The house, which was after the conventional
pattern of the Washington furnished house of
those days, struck a chill to Colonel Berkeley’s
heart.</p>

<p>“My love,” he said, disconsolately, looking at the
dull grates in the two square drawing-rooms, “I’m
afraid I’ll lose all my domestic virtues around this
miserable travesty of a hearth.”</p>

<p>“Just wait, papa,” answered Olivia, with one of
her encouraging smiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“I knew how it would be. Wait until some of
those big boxes are unpacked that you swore so
about.”</p>

<p>When the boxes were unpacked, they were found
to contain the old fashioned brass andirons and fenders
that had shone upon the cheerful hearths at
Isleham for many years. Olivia in a trice, had the
grates out and managed to have a wood fire sparkling
where once they were. Then she produced a
great porcelain lamp they had brought from France
with them, and some tall silver candlesticks and candelabra,
which vastly improved the mantels, and she
re-arranged the tasteless furniture and bric-à-brac
with such skill that she cheated herself as well as
others into believing them pretty.</p>

<p>It was rather an effort to Pembroke, his first
visit. He would not take Miles with him lest he
should seem to fear to go alone. It was now five
years past. Naturally they had met often, but in
some way, this meeting impressed him differently.
He had at last waked up to the fact that he could
not forget Olivia Berkeley. It angered him against
himself&mdash;and so it was in rather an unamiable mood
that he left the House early, and took his way
through a drizzling rain to the Berkeleys’. When
he rung the bell, Petrarch’s familiar black face
greeted him.</p>

<p>“Hi, howdy, Marse French. It do my heart
good ter see you. Ole Marse, I spec he everlastin’
cuss when he fin’ out you been here an’ he ain’t
home. Miss Livy, she in de settin’ room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“And how are you all getting on here?” asked
Pembroke, as Petrarch officiously helped him off
with his great-coat.</p>

<p>“Tollerbul, tollerbul, sir. Old marse, he mighty
orkard sometimes. He swar an’ takes de Lord’s
name in vain, spite o’ de commandment ‘Doan
never you swar at all.’ I try ter make him behave
hisse’f ter de policemens an’ sech, but he quile all
de time he gwine long de street.”</p>

<p>He ushered Pembroke through the drawing-room,
into a little room beyond. On a sofa drawn up to
the wood fire, sat Olivia, making a pretty home-like
picture, in the half light, contrasted with the dreary
drawing-room beyond, and the dismal drizzle outside.</p>

<p>They had not met for nearly two years. The
session of Congress had lasted almost through the
year, and when he had been in the county last,
Olivia was away in the mountains. He noticed
instantly that she was very, very pretty, but her
beauty had taken a graver and more womanly cast.
Oh, the elaborate ease, to cover the overpowering
awkwardness of those former tête-à-tête meetings!
Pembroke felt this acutely when he first saw her&mdash;but
it vanished strangely at the moment that Olivia
held out her little hand and spoke to him. Her
voice, her manner, were pleasantly natural. It carried
him back to the old days when he was gradually
slipping into love with her. How grateful
and soothing had been her native charm as an
escape from Madame Koller’s exaggerated heroics!</p>

<p>“Papa will be sorry to miss you,” she said pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
him to the easiest chair, and putting her feet
comfortably on a footstool.</p>

<p>“Do you think you’ll like it?” asked Pembroke.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was going to ask you.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t ask me. You know Congressmen
are received in society only on sufferance. I exist
on the borders as it were, and am permitted to dwell
there in spite of, not because I am a Congressman.”</p>

<p>Olivia smiled and nodded her head.</p>

<p>“I know how it is,” she said, “I’ve heard.”</p>

<p>“Now what do you want to do first?”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Olivia, propping her rounded chin
on her hand, “I should like to go to a ball. I have
not been to a real ball for six years&mdash;not since we
left Paris. You may be surprised at this frivolity
in one of my years&mdash;you know I am getting out of
my twenties awfully fast&mdash;but it is still a fact.”</p>

<p>“Your age is certainly imposing. There is a
superb ball to be given at the Russian Legation next
week&mdash;the Minister is a new man&mdash;just come. I
received a card, and I can get one for you and your
father through one of the secretaries of legation
who is my friend.”</p>

<p>Pembroke produced a handsome invitation card,
bearing the name of the Russian Minister and
Madame Volkonsky.</p>

<p>Olivia’s eyes sparkled. She loved balls as the
normal girl always does.</p>

<p>“And I shall go out to-morrow morning and
buy a ball gown. Shall I have white tulle and
water lilies, or peach-blow satin?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>“White, by all means,” answered Pembroke,
gravely. “I like to see women in white.”</p>

<p>“A white gown,” continued Olivia, reflectively,
“is always safest.”</p>

<p>“I suppose, you will go to balls all the time
after this one. It will be like the first taste of
blood to a tiger.”</p>

<p>“Yes, after a long period of&mdash;what do you call
it&mdash;graminivorous diet. By the way, some friends
of yours came to see me to-day. The De Peysters.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I like them very much. Helena is a charming
little thing.”</p>

<p>“Delightful girl,” echoed Olivia, with much more
emphasis than the subject required.</p>

<p>Pembroke had only intended to pay an ordinary
afternoon call, but it was so unexpectedly pleasant
sitting there with Olivia that the fall of night and
the Colonel’s return both took him unawares. The
Colonel was delighted to see him.</p>

<p>“This is pleasant,” cried he, standing with his broad
back to the fire, and stroking his white mustache.
“I brought my riding horse up, and Olivia’s, too,
and I sent Petrarch around this morning to make
a permanent arrangement. The rogue of a livery
man asked me such a stupendous price that I was
forced to send him word I didn’t desire board for
myself and my daughter included with the horses.
Ah, times are changed&mdash;times are changed! Sad
lot of you in public life now, begad.”</p>

<p>“Very sad lot, sir.”</p>

<p>“If we could only get back to Old Hickory in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
the White House, and the mail twice a week from
New York, brought in the stage coach&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And Old Hickory’s <i>penchant</i> for Mrs. Eaton,
and half the Congress getting tight at the White
House New Year’s Day. We ought to have it
all.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;Zounds, sir, we ought to have it
all!”</p>

<p>Then there was the ball to talk about, and presently,
Pembroke declining the Colonel’s hearty
invitation to stay and dine off whatever miserable
fare a city market afforded, and try some port
he had brought from Virginia, knowing there was
nothing fit to drink to be had in Washington, he left.
Olivia’s invitation to stay was rather faint&mdash;had it
been heartier, perhaps he might have remained.
As it was, he went home, and surprised Miles by
coming in whistling jovially.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night of the ball arrived. Olivia and her
father, the De Peysters and Pembroke had all
agreed to go in one party. The De Peysters had
been very kind and attentive to Olivia. Her gentle
ways had captivated Mrs. De Peyster, and the
fun innate in her had done the same for Helena.
They had asked Olivia to receive with them on
their reception day, and she had made quite a little
success on her first appearance in Washington
society. She sat behind a cosy tea table in an
alcove, and poured tea with much grace. She was
a good linguist, and put two or three young diplomatists,
struggling with the English tongue, at ease
by talking to them in their own language. She
possessed the indefinable charm of good breeding,
never more effective than when contrasted with
the flamboyant, cosmopolitan Washington society.
The women soon found out that the men
flocked around her. She had half a dozen invitations
before the day was out. Helena, a soft, blonde,
kittenish young thing, was in raptures over her,
admiring her as only a very young girl can admire
and adore one a little older than herself. Pembroke
was among the later callers, and, strange to
say, Miles was with him. There were but few persons
there by that time, and these Mrs. De Peyster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
was entertaining in the large drawing-room. Helena
brought Miles into the little alcove and plied
him with soft speeches, tea and cakes. Pembroke
and Olivia sitting by exchanged smiles at the two
enjoying themselves boy and girl fashion. Helena
was but nineteen, and Miles had not yet passed his
twenty-third birthday. The horror of his wound
was added to by the youth of his features.</p>

<p>“Now take this little cake,” said Helena, earnestly.
“I made these myself. Do you know that I can
make cakes?”</p>

<p>“What an accomplished girl! I shall be afraid
of you. I learned to make ash cakes during the
war,” answered Miles as gravely.</p>

<p>“What is an ash cake, pray?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s&mdash;it’s&mdash;corn bread baked in the ashes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how funny! And how do you get the ashes
off?”</p>

<p>“Wash them off.”</p>

<p>In the course of the discussion Miles had quite
forgotten a piteous and ineffective little stratagem
of his to turn the uninjured side of his face toward
whom he was addressing. He leaned forward, gazing
into Helena’s pretty but somewhat meaningless
face, just as any other youngster might have done,
and Helena, with youthful seriousness, had plunged
into the sentimental discussion wherein the American
girl is prone to fall. Pembroke would have
gone after ten minutes, but Miles was so evidently
enjoying himself, that the elder brother stayed on.
It was like the afternoon at Olivia’s house&mdash;so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
home-like and pleasant&mdash;Olivia and himself keeping
up a desultory conversation while they sipped
tea and listened half-amused to the two youngsters
on the other side of the round table. Olivia glanced
at the clock over the mantel&mdash;it was half-past six.</p>

<p>“I must go,” she said. “I shall just have time
for my dinner and for an hour’s rest before I dress
for the ball.”</p>

<p>Mrs. De Peyster and Helena urged her to remain
and dine, but Olivia declined, and the servant
announced her carriage. Pembroke put her white
burnous around her in the hall, and handed her to
her carriage. They were all to meet at the Russian
Legation at half-past ten.</p>

<p>At that hour the broad street in front of the Legation
was packed with carriages. An awning for the
waiting footmen extended on each side of the broad
porte cochére. Half a dozen policemen kept the
carriages in line and the coachmen in order&mdash;for
this was the great ball of the season, a royal grand
duke was to be present, and the fame of Madame
Volkonsky’s beauty had gone far and wide. The
vast house blazed with lights, and amid the rolling
of wheels, and the hubbub of many voices could be
heard the strains of an orchestra floating out.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment the carriages containing
Olivia and her father, Pembroke and the
De Peysters drove up, and the party vanished upstairs.</p>

<p>“How beautiful you are!” cried Helena delightedly,
up in the dressing room, as Olivia dropped her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
wraps and appeared in her dainty white toilette,
Olivia blushed with gratified vanity. Her dress was
the perfection of simplicity, soft and diaphanous,
and around her milk white arms and throat were
her mother’s pearls.</p>

<p>As the three ladies came out into the brilliant
corridor to meet their escorts, Pembroke received a
kind of thrill at Olivia’s beauty&mdash;a beauty which
had never struck him very forcibly before. She
was undoubtedly pretty and graceful, and he had
often admired her slight and willowy figure&mdash;but
she had grown beautiful in her solitary country life&mdash;beautiful
with patience, courage and womanliness.
The Colonel, in a superb swallow-tail of the style of
ten years past, his coat-tails lined with white satin,
his snowy ruffle falling over the bosom of his waistcoat,
his fine curling white hair combed carefully
down upon his velvet collar in the old fashion, offered
his arm like a prince to Mrs. De Peyster, herself a
stately and imposing matron, and proud to be
escorted by such a chevalier. Pembroke walked
beside Olivia and Helena down the broad staircase.</p>

<p>Is there any form of social life more imposing
than a really splendid ball? The tall and nodding
ferns and palms, the penetrating odor of flowers,
the clash of music, the brilliant crowd moving to
and fro through the great drawing-rooms and halls,
brought a deeper flush to Olivia’s cheek. She felt
like a débutante.</p>

<p>They made their way slowly toward the upper
end of the last of a noble suite of rooms. Pembroke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
was just saying in low tone to the two girls,
“I have looked out for your interests with the
Grand Duke. My friend Ryleief has promised to
present both of you&mdash;an honor I waived for myself,
as being quite beneath the Grand Duke’s notice,
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Colonel and Miss Berkeley, Mrs. and Miss de
Peyster; Mr. Pembroke&mdash;” was bawled out by
Pembroke’s friend, Ryleief who was making the
introductions to the new Minister and his wife&mdash;and
the party stood face to face with Ahlberg and
Madame Koller.</p>

<p>The rencontre was so staggering and unexpected
that Pembroke quite lost his self-possession. He
gazed stupidly at the pair before him&mdash;M. and
Madame Volkonsky, who had formed much of his
life five years before as Ahlberg and Elise Koller.
He saw Ahlberg’s breast covered with orders, and he
wore an elaborate court suit. Madame Koller, or
Madame Volkonsky, blazed with diamonds. Her
hair was as blonde and as abundant as ever, and
far behind her streamed a gorgeous satin train of
the same golden hue as her hair.</p>

<p>Olivia, too, felt that sudden shock at meeting
people who rise, as it were, like the dead from their
graves. She felt also that repulsion that came from
a knowledge of both of them. She could only
silently bow as they were presented. But both
M. and Madame Volkonsky expressed more than
mere surprise at the meeting. Ahlberg or Volkonsky
as he now was, turned excessively pale. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
uncertain glance fell on Pembroke, and turned
again on his wife. As for her, the same pallor
showed under the delicate rouge on her cheek, but
women rally more quickly under these things than
men do. Besides, she had contemplated the possibility
of meeting some of these people, and was
not altogether unprepared for it.</p>

<p>If, however, the blankness of amazement had seized
upon Olivia and Pembroke, and if the De Peysters
were also a little unnerved by the strangeness of
what was occurring before them, Colonel Berkeley
was as cool as a cucumber. He held out his hand
warmly. He rolled out his salutations in a loud,
rich voice.</p>

<p>“Why, how do you do Eliza. You’ll excuse an
old man, my dear, for calling you by your first
name, won’t you? And my friend Ahlberg that
was. This is delightful,” he added, looking around
as if to challenge the whole party.</p>

<p>In the midst of the strange sensations which agitated
him, Pembroke could scarcely forbear from
laughing at the Colonel’s greeting, and the effect it
produced. Madame Volkonsky flushed violently,
still under her rouge, while Volkonsky’s face was
a study in its helpless rage. Poor Ryleief, with a
mob of fine people surging up to be introduced, was
yet so consumed with curiosity, that he held them
all at bay, and looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>“Does Madame understand that gentleman?”
he asked in French, eagerly&mdash;</p>

<p>“Of course she does, my dear fellow,” heartily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
responded Colonel Berkeley in English. “She
spoke English long before she learned Rooshan, if
she ever learned it. Hay, Eliza?”</p>

<p>The Colonel’s manner was so very dignified, and
although jovial, so far removed from familiarity,
that Madame Volkonsky did not know whether
to be pleased by the recognition or annoyed. If,
as it was likely, it should come out that she was an
American, here were people of the best standing
who could vouch at least for her origin. She held
out her hand to the Colonel, and said rapidly in
French:</p>

<p>“I am very glad to meet you. I cannot say
much here, but I hope to see you presently.”
When Pembroke made his bow and passed, Volkonsky
called up all his ineffable assurance and
gave him a scowl, which Pembroke received with a
bow and a cool smile that was sarcasm itself.
Madame Volkonsky did not look at him as she
bowed, nor did he look at her.</p>

<p>In a moment they were clear of the press. The
De Peysters were full of curiosity.</p>

<p>“Who were they? Who are they?” breathlessly
asked Helena.</p>

<p>“My dear young lady,” responded the Colonel,
smoothing down his shirt-frill with his delicate old
hand, “Who they were I can very easily tell you.
Who they are, I am blessed if I know.”</p>

<p>While the Colonel was giving a highly picturesque
account of Eliza Peyton through all her transformations
until she came to be Elise Koller, since when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
Colonel Berkeley had no knowledge of her whatever,
Pembroke had given his arm to Olivia, and
they moved off into a quiet corner, where the
spreading leaves of a great palm made a little solitude
in the midst of the crowd, and the lights and
the crash of music and the beating of the dancers’
feet in the distance. Pembroke was alternately
pale and red. Madame Volkonsky was nothing
to him now, but he hated Volkonsky with the
reprehensible but eminently human hatred that one
man sometimes feels for another. Volkonsky was
a scoundrel and an imposter. It made him furious
to think that he should have dared to return to
America, albeit he should come as the accredited
Minister of a great power. It showed a defiance of
what he, Pembroke, knew and could relate of him,
that was infuriating to his self-love. For Elise, he
did not know exactly what he most felt&mdash;whether
pity or contempt. And the very last time that he
and Olivia Berkeley had discussed Madame Koller
was on that April night in the old garden at
Isleham&mdash;a recollection far from pleasant.</p>

<p>“Papa’s remark that this meeting was delightful,
struck me as rather ingeniously inappropriate,” said
Olivia, seeking the friendly cover of a joke. “It is
frightfully embarrassing to meet people this way.”</p>

<p>“Very,” sententiously answered Pembroke. He
was still in a whirl.</p>

<p>Then there was a pause. Suddenly Pembroke
bent over toward her and said distinctly:</p>

<p>“Olivia, did you ever doubt what I told you that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
night in the garden about Madame Koller? that
she was then, and had been for a long time, nothing
to me? Did you ever have a renewal of your unjust
suspicions?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Olivia, as clearly, after a short
silence.</p>

<p>In another instant they were among the crowd
of dancers in the ball room. Neither knew exactly
how they happened to get there. Pembroke did
not often dance, and was rather surprised when he
found himself whirling around the ball room with
Olivia, to the rhythm of a dreamy waltz. It was soon
over. It came back to Olivia that she ought not so
soon to part company with the De Peysters, and
she stopped at once, thereby cutting short her own
rapture as well as Pembroke’s. Without a word,
Pembroke led her back to where the Colonel and
Mrs. De Peyster and Helena were. Helena’s pretty
face wore a cloud. She had not yet been asked to
dance, and was more puzzled than pleased at the
meeting which she had witnessed in all its strangeness.
Pembroke good naturedly took her for a
turn and brought her back with her card half filled
and the smiles dimpling all over her face.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the ball went on merrily. Ryleief
escaped from his post as soon as possible and
sought Pembroke.</p>

<p>“So you knew M. Volkonsky?” he said eagerly,
in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Pembroke&mdash;and his look and tone
expressed volumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>Ryleief held him by the arm, and whispered:</p>

<p>“This is confidential. I suspected from the first
that our new chief was&mdash;eh&mdash;you know&mdash;not
exactly&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Pembroke, “not exactly a gentleman.
An arrant knave and coward, in short.”</p>

<p>Ryleief, a mature diplomatic sprig, looked fixedly
at Pembroke, his hard Muscovite face growing expressive.</p>

<p>“Speaking as friends, my dear Pembroke&mdash;and,
you understand in my position the necessity of
prudence&mdash;M. Volkonsky is not unknown among
the Russian diplomats. He has been recalled once&mdash;warned
repeatedly. Once, some years ago, it
was supposed he had been dismissed from the
diplomatic corps. But he reappeared about five
years ago under another name&mdash;he was originally
an Ahlberg. He certainly inherited some money,
married some more, and took the name of Volkonsky&mdash;said
it was a condition of his fortune.
He has been <i>chargé d’affaires</i> at Munich&mdash;later at
Lisbon&mdash;both promotions for him. What his
power is at the Foreign Office I know not&mdash;certainly
not his family, because he has none. It is
said he is a Swiss.”</p>

<p>“He will not be long here,” remarked Pembroke.
Then Pembroke went away and wandered about,
feeling uncomfortable, as every man does, under
the same roof as his enemy. He felt no compunction
as to being the guest of Volkonsky. The
legation was Russian property&mdash;the ball itself was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
not paid for out of Volkonsky’s own pocket, but
by his government. Pembroke felt, though, that
when it came out, as it must, the part that he
would take in exposing the Russian Minister, his
presence at the ball might not be understood, and
he would gladly have left the instant he found out
who Volkonsky really was but for the Berkeleys
and the De Peysters.</p>

<p>He stood off and watched the two girls as they
danced&mdash;both with extreme grace. There was no
lack of partners for them. Mrs. De Peyster, with
the Colonel hovering near her, did not have her
charges on her hands for much of the time. The
truth is, Olivia, although the shock and surprise of
meeting two people who were connected with a
painful part of her life was unpleasant, yet was she
still young and fresh enough to feel the intoxication
of a ball. The music got into her feet, the
lights and flowers dazzled her eyes. She was old
enough to seize the present moment of enjoyment,
and to postpone unpleasant things to the morrow,
and young enough to feel a keen enjoyment in the
present. She would never come to another ball at
the Russian Legation, so there was that much
more reason she should enjoy this one.</p>

<p>As Pembroke passed near her once she made a
little mocking mouth at him.</p>

<p>“Your friend, Ryleief, promised that I should be
introduced to the Grand Duke&mdash;and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Look out,” answered Pembroke, laughing, “he
is coming this way. Now look your best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>At that very instant Ryleief was making his way
toward them with the Grand Duke, a tall, military
looking fellow, who surveyed the crowd with very
unpretending good humor. Pembroke saw the
presentation made, and Olivia drop a courtesy,
which Helena De Peyster, at her elbow, imitated as
the scion of royalty bowed to her. The Grand
Duke squared off and began a conversation with
Olivia. She had the sort of training to pay him
the delicate flattery which princes love, but she
had the American sense of humor which the continental
foreigners find so captivating. Pembroke, still
smiling to himself, imagined the platitudes his
royal highness was bestowing upon the young
American girl, when suddenly the Grand Duke’s
mouth opened wide, and he laughed outright at
something Olivia had said. Thenceforth her fortune
was made with the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>The next thing Pembroke saw was Olivia placing
her hand in the Grand Duke’s, and the pair went
sailing around the room in the peculiar slow and
ungraceful waltz danced by foreigners. Olivia had
no difficulty in keeping step with her six-foot
Grand Duke, and really danced the awkward dance
as gracefully as it could be done. Mrs. De Peyster’s
face glowed as they passed. Olivia was chaperoned
by her, and as such she enjoyed a reflected
glory. The great maternal instinct welled up in her&mdash;she
glanced at Helena&mdash;but Helena was so young&mdash;a
mere chit&mdash;and Mrs. De Peyster was not of an
envious nature. Colonel Berkeley felt a kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
pride at the success Olivia was making, but when a
superb dowager sitting next Mrs. De Peyster asked,
in a loud whisper, if he was “the father of Miss
Berkeley,” the Colonel’s wrath rose. He made a
courtly bow, and explained that Miss Berkeley was
the daughter of Colonel Berkeley, of Virginia.</p>

<p>Not only once did the Grand Duke dance with
Olivia, but twice&mdash;and he asked permission to call
on her the next afternoon.</p>

<p>“With the greatest pleasure,” answered Olivia
gayly&mdash;“and&mdash;pray don’t forget to come.”</p>

<p>At which the Grand Duke grinned like any other
man at a merry challenge from a girl.</p>

<p>At last the ball was over. Toward two o’clock
Pembroke put the ladies of his party in their carriages
and started to walk home. Madame Volkonsky
had not been able to spoil the ball for
Olivia.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she cried to Pembroke, waving her
hand. “To-morrow at four o’clock he comes&mdash;I
shall begin making my toilette at twelve.”</p>

<p>“Very pretty ball of Eliza Peyton’s,” said the
Colonel, settling himself back in the carriage and
buttoning up his great-coat. “Volkonsky&mdash;ha!
ha! And that fellow, Ahlberg&mdash;by Gad! an infernal
sneaking cur&mdash;I beg your pardon, my dear, for swearing,
but of all the damned impostors I ever saw M.
Volkonsky is the greatest, excepting always Eliza
Peyton.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Olivia might wince, and the Colonel
chuckle over the Volkonsky incident, it was a more
serious matter to Volkonsky. He had certainly
taken into account the possibility of meeting some
old acquaintances, but neither he nor Madame Volkonsky
had cared to keep up with events in the
remote county in Virginia, where they had passed
some agitating days. Volkonsky therefore was
quite unaware that Pembroke was in Congress. The
first meeting to him was an unpleasant shock, as he
had learned to fear Pembroke much in other days.
But when he began to inquire quietly about him
of Ryleief, who evidently knew him, Volkonsky’s
discomfort was very much increased. For Ryleief,
who rather exaggerated the influence of a representative
in Congress, impressed forcibly upon
Volkonsky that Pembroke possessed power&mdash;and
when Volkonsky began to take in that Pembroke’s
determined enmity as a member of the Foreign
Affairs Committee might amount to something, he
began to be much disturbed. Before the last guest
had rolled away from the door on the night of the
ball, Volkonsky and his wife were closeted together
in the Minister’s little study. Whatever
passing fancy Madame Volkonsky might have
entertained for Pembroke some years ago, Volkonsky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
was quite indifferent&mdash;and if Pembroke retained
any lingering weakness for her&mdash;well enough&mdash;he
might be induced to let Volkonsky dwell in
peace.</p>

<p>When Madame Volkonsky entered the room,
her husband placed a chair for her. Often they
quarreled, and sometimes they were reported to
fight, but he never omitted those little attentions.
Madame Volkonsky’s face was pale. She did not
know how much lay in Pembroke’s power to harm
them, but she was shaken by the encounter. It
was hard, just at the opening of a new life, to meet
those people. It was so easy to be good now.
They were free for a time from duns and creditors&mdash;for
during her marriage to Ahlberg she had become
acquainted with both. She had a fine establishment,
a splendid position&mdash;and at the very outset
arose the ghost of a dead and gone fancy, and
the woman before whom she had in vain humiliated
herself, and the man who knew enough to ruin her
husband. It was trying and it made her look weary
and very old. Volkonsky began in French:</p>

<p>“So you met your old acquaintances to-night.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That charming M. le Colonel called you Eliza
Peyton.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” again answered Madame Volkonsky.</p>

<p>“This comes of that crazy expedition to America
which I tried to dissuade you from.”</p>

<p>Madame Volkonsky again nodded. She was
not usually so meek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“And that haughty, overbearing Pembroke.
Does he still cherish that romantic sentiment for
you, I wonder.”</p>

<p>Madame Volkonsky blushed faintly. She was
not as devoid of delicacy as her husband.</p>

<p>“If he does,” continued Volkonsky, meditatively,
“he might be induced&mdash;if you should appeal
to him&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Appeal to him for what?” inquired Madame
Volkonsky, rising and turning paler. The contempt
in her tone angered Volkonsky.</p>

<p>“Not to ruin us. That man is now in the Congress.
He has to do with foreign affairs. He hates
me, and, by God, I hate him. He knows things
that may cause you to give up this establishment&mdash;that
may send us back across the water
under unpleasant circumstances. You know about
the dispute at cards, and other things&mdash;you have
not failed to remind me of them,&mdash;and if Pembroke
is disposed he can use this with frightful effect
now.”</p>

<p>Madame Volkonsky remained perfectly silent.
She was stunned by the information Volkonsky
gave her&mdash;but Volkonsky was quite oblivious of
her feelings. He was gnawing his yellow mustache.</p>

<p>“You might see him,” he said. “You might
appeal to him&mdash;throw yourself on his mercy&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What a wretch you are,” suddenly burst out
Madame Volkonsky in English. They had talked
in French all this time, which she spoke apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
as well as English&mdash;but like most people, she fell
into the vernacular when under the influence of
strong emotion. Volkonsky glanced up at her.</p>

<p>“What is it now?” he asked, peevishly.</p>

<p>His wife turned two blazing eyes on him. The
fact that she was not upon a very high plane herself
did not prevent her from being indignant at
his baseness&mdash;and wounded pride drove home the
thrust.</p>

<p>“That you should dare, that any man should
dare&mdash;to propose that a wife should work on a
man’s past liking for her to serve her husband’s
ends. Ahlberg, every day that I have lived with
you has shown me new baseness in you.”</p>

<p>This was not the first time Volkonsky had
heard this&mdash;but it was none the less unpleasant.
Also, he rather dreaded Madame Volkonsky’s
occasional outbursts of temper&mdash;and he had had
enough for one night.</p>

<p>“It is no time for us to quarrel&mdash;and particularly
do not call me Ahlberg. My name is now legally
Volkonsky, and I would wish to forget it ever was
anything else. We should better design how to
keep this Pembroke at bay. I am sure,” continued
Volkonsky plaintively, “I have never sought to
injure him. Why should he try to ruin me for a
little scene at a card table that occurred five years
ago? I wonder if that ferocious Cave will turn up
soon?”</p>

<p>Madame Volkonsky turned and left him in disgust.
In spite of her cosmopolitan education, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
all her associations, there was born with her an
admiration for Anglo-Saxon pluck which made her
despise Volkonsky methods. The idea of scheming
and designing to placate a man who had caught
him cheating at cards filled her with infinite contempt.</p>

<p>In the course of the next few days, Madame
Volkonsky was deeply exercised over the influence
that Pembroke would have upon her future. She
had talked their affairs over often with her husband
in those few days. He had not failed to convey to
her the rather exaggerated impression that he had
received from Ryleief, as to Pembroke’s power to
harm.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when Volkonsky and his wife
were driving in their victoria, they passed the Secretary
of State’s carriage drawn up to the sidewalk.
Pembroke was about to step into it. The
Secretary himself, a handsome, elderly man, was
leaning forward to greet him, as Pembroke placed
his foot on the step. Madame Volkonsky looked
at her husband, who looked blankly back in return.
The Secretary’s carriage whirled around, and both
gentlemen bowed&mdash;the Secretary to both the Minister
and his wife, Pembroke pointedly to Madame
Volkonsky.</p>

<p>Volkonsky turned a little pale as they drove off.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the Secretary will ever speak to us
again,” said Madame Volkonsky, half maliciously.</p>

<p>Yet it was as much to her as to him. It would
indeed be hard were they driven in disgrace from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Washington. Volkonsky had been surprisingly
lucky all his life, but luck always takes a turn.
Now, his recall as Minister would be of more consequence
than his escapades as attaché or Secretary
of Legation. Then, he had played wild works
with her fortune, such as it was. Madame Volkonsky’s
thoughts grew bitter. First had come
that struggle of her girlhood&mdash;then her artistic
career&mdash;ending in a cruel failure. Afterward the
dreadful years of life tied to Koller’s bath chair&mdash;followed
by her stormy and disappointed widowhood.
This was the first place she had ever gained
that promised security or happiness&mdash;and behold!
all was likely to fall like a house of cards.</p>

<p>They paid one or two visits, and left cards at
several places. Madame Volkonsky had imagined
that nothing could dull the exquisite pleasure
of being a personage, of being followed, flattered,
admired. She found out differently. The fame of
her beauty and accomplishments had preceded her.
Everywhere she received the silent ovation which
is the right of a beautiful and charming woman&mdash;but
her heart was heavy. At one place she passed
Olivia and her father coming out as they were
going in. Olivia, wrapped in furs, looked uncommonly
pretty and free from care. As the two
women passed, each, while smiling affably, wore
that hostile air which ladies are liable to assume
under the circumstances. The Colonel was all
bows and smiles to Madame Volkonsky as usual,
and refrained from calling her Eliza.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>Nor did the presence of the Volkonskys in
Washington conduce to Olivia’s enjoyment although
it certainly did to her father’s. The Colonel was
delighted. In the course of years, Eliza Peyton
had afforded him great amusement. He was a
chivalrous man to women, although not above
teasing Madame Volkonsky, but he refrained
from doing what poor Elise very much dreaded he
would&mdash;telling of her American origin. She had
admitted that her mother was an American&mdash;an
admission necessary to account for the native,
idiomatic way in which she spoke the English language,
and Colonel Berkeley knowing this, did not
hesitate to say that in years gone by, he had
known Madame Volkonsky’s mother, and very
cheerfully bore testimony to the fact that the
mother had been of good family and gentle breeding.
So instead of being a disadvantage to her, it
was rather a help. But Olivia and herself were so
distinctly antipathetic that it could scarcely fail to
produce antagonism. And besides her whole course
about Pembroke had shocked Olivia. Olivia was
amazed&mdash;it was not the mere difference of conduct
and opinion&mdash;it was the difference of temperament.
Remembering that Madame Volkonsky had at
least the inheritance of refinement, and was quite
at home in the usages of gentle breeding, it
seemed the more inexcusable. In all those years
Olivia had been unable to define her feelings to
Pembroke. She could easily have persuaded herself
that she was quite indifferent to him except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
that she could not forget him. It annoyed her.
It was like a small, secret pain, a trifling malady,
of which the sufferer is ashamed to speak.</p>

<p>Not so Pembroke. The love that survives such
a blow to pride and vanity as a refusal, is love
indeed&mdash;and after the first tempest of mortification
he had realized that his passion would not die, but
needed to be killed&mdash;and after five years of partial
absence, awkward estrangement, all those things
which do most effectually kill everything which is
not love, her presence was yet sweet and potent.
The discovery afforded him a certain grim amusement.
He was getting well on in his thirties. His
hair was turning prematurely gray, and he felt that
youth was behind him&mdash;a not altogether unpleasant
feeling to an ambitious man. Nevertheless,
they went on dining together at the Berkeleys’
own house, at the De Peysters’, at other places,
meeting constantly at the same houses&mdash;for Pembroke
went out more than he had ever done in
Washington before, drawn subtly by the chance of
meeting Olivia&mdash;although where once she was cool
and friendly, she was now a little warmer in her
manner, yet not wholly free from embarrassment.
But neither was unhappy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A month</span>&mdash;six weeks&mdash;two months passed after
the Russian Minister’s ball. The Grand Duke had
called informally on the President, accompanied of
course by the Minister, but his visit to Washington
was so brief that all formal courtesies were postponed
until he returned from his travels in the
Northwest, which would not be until spring.
This was the time that Volkonsky looked forward
to as deciding his fate. During the Grand
Duke’s first brief visit, Pembroke did not know of
Volkonsky’s diplomatic short-comings&mdash;nor until
the last moment did he know that Volkonsky
was Ahlberg. He was one of those intensely
human men, who like fighting, especially if there is
glory to be won&mdash;and he enjoyed a savage satisfaction
in thinking that he would be the instrument
of Ahlberg’s punishment&mdash;and the prospect of the
catastrophe occurring during the Grand Duke’s visit,
so there could be no misunderstanding or glozing
over of the matter, filled him with what the moralists
would call an unholy joy. He and Volkonsky
had met often since the night of the ball, but never
alone. The fact is, Volkonsky had his wife for a
body guard. She was always with him in those
days, sitting by his side in her carriage, or else close
at his elbow. One day, however, as Volkonsky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
was coming out of the State Department, he met
Pembroke face to face.</p>

<p>Pembroke had chafed with inward fury at the
cleverness with which Volkonsky had managed
to avoid him. Therefore when he passed the Russian
Minister’s carriage with Madame Volkonsky
sitting in it alone at the foot of the steps, he was
certain that Volkonsky was in the State Department,
and that he could catch him&mdash;for it had
assumed the form of a flight and a pursuit. Pembroke
took off his hat and bowed profoundly to
Madame Volkonsky. She could not but fancy
there was a glimmer of sarcasm in his manner&mdash;a
sarcasm she returned by a bow still lower. Pembroke
could have leaped up the steps in his anxiety
to reach the building before Volkonsky left&mdash;but
he controlled himself and mounted leisurely. Once
inside the door, he started at a long stride down the
corridor, and in two minutes he had, figuratively
speaking, collared Volkonsky.</p>

<p>“I want to speak with you,” said Pembroke.</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” responded Volkonsky, “but I
may ask you to be brief, as Madame Volkonsky
awaits me in her carriage.”</p>

<p>“I will be brief. But I desire you to come to
my club&mdash;here is my card&mdash;at six o’clock this
evening.”</p>

<p>Volkonsky straightened himself up. He determined
not to yield without making a fight for it.</p>

<p>“Are you aware of your language, Meestar
Pembroke?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“Perfectly,” answered Pembroke coolly. “Come
or stay&mdash;do as you like. It is your only chance
of getting away from the United States quietly&mdash;and
this chance is given you not for yourself but
for your wife.”</p>

<p>Pembroke had kept his hat on his head purposely
all this time. Volkonsky had removed his, but
seeing Pembroke remain covered, put it back also.
The two men gazed at each other for a moment,
and then each went his way. But Pembroke knew
in that moment that Volkonsky would come.</p>

<p>Once down in the carriage, Volkonsky directed
the coachman to drive toward the country. It was
a charming morning in early spring. Madame Volkonsky
had expected to enjoy the drive, but
when she saw Volkonsky’s face she changed her
anticipations.</p>

<p>“What did he say?” she asked, almost before
the footman had mounted.</p>

<p>Volkonsky reflected for a moment, and then
answered grimly:</p>

<p>“He has offered me a chance to get away
quietly.”</p>

<p>Madame Volkonsky said no more. Volkonsky
began gnawing his mustache&mdash;a trick that Ahlberg
had before. He did not speak until they were out
in the country lanes. The fresh spring air brought
no bloom to Madame Volkonsky’s pallid face.</p>

<p>“But for the frightful insolence of the fellow,”
began Volkonsky after a while, “it might not
be so bad. He is willing to negotiate. He has not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
gone yet to the Secretary of State with&mdash;with&mdash;his
accusations. But the Secretary suspects me. I
saw it in his face more plainly this morning than
ever before. And there are certain things in connection
with my negotiations&mdash;Great God! What
a country! I communicate with the Department
of State on certain diplomatic matters. The Department
tells me that the Senate has called for
information in the matter, and all my communications
are handed over to a Senate Committee. Then
the Lower House imagines there is a commercial
question involved, and invites its Foreign Affairs
Committee to take charge of it. There is no diplomacy
in this miserable country,” he cried, throwing
out his hands. “The State Department is a puppet
in the hands of Congress. No diplomatist can
understand this when he comes here&mdash;or after.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” responded Madame Volkonsky,
with a spice of sarcasm in her that never wholly
left her. “None of you Foreign Office people
know anything of the workings of the United
States Government.” This angered Volkonsky.
He broke out&mdash;</p>

<p>“There is more yet to tell. This wretched <i>canaille</i>
they call the Lower House, this Foreign Affairs
Committee&mdash;is subdivided into numerous smaller
committees&mdash;and the one in charge of our negotiation
is virtually Pembroke&mdash;Pembroke himself!”</p>

<p>Madame Volkonsky fell back in the carriage.
She did not wholly understand what this meant, but
she knew from Volkonsky’s manner, assisted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
her own slight knowledge, that Pembroke was in
some way the arbiter of Volkonsky’s fate.</p>

<p>“And there are documents&mdash;letters&mdash;that Pembroke
has called for, and the State Department has
produced&mdash;that in the hands of an enemy&mdash;”</p>

<p>He struck his knee with his clinched fist. Disgrace
stared him in the face&mdash;and the Grand Duke
himself here&mdash;lying would do no good&mdash;and when
that device would no longer avail him, Volkonsky
felt that his situation was indeed desperate.</p>

<p>Both remained silent a long time. The carriage
rolled along slowly. The road was smooth and
bordered with beech and poplar trees, upon whose
silvery branches the first tender shoots were coming
out. The air was full of the subtle perfume of
the coming leaves. But both the man and the
woman were city bred. They neither understood
nor cared for such things. Presently Madame Volkonsky
touched her husband. Ahead of them
they saw two figures. They were Olivia Berkeley
and Miles Pembroke, walking gayly along the path,
talking merrily. The sight of their innocent gayety
smote Madame Volkonsky to the heart with
envy. She had never been able to enjoy simple
pleasures. A country walk, with a mere nobody, a
boy younger than herself, with no one to admire,
to notice, could never have pleased her. All her
pleasures were of the costly kind&mdash;costly in money,
in talents, in rank. She blamed fate at that moment
for making her that way, and envied instead
of despising Olivia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>The two by the roadside bowed&mdash;and the two in
the carriage returned it smilingly. But the smile
died the instant their heads were turned.</p>

<p>Volkonsky said presently to his wife:</p>

<p>“We must not show the white feather. You
must sing to-night.”</p>

<p>This brought Madame Volkonsky up with a
turn. Her conversation with her husband had
quite put out of her mind something that had
engrossed her very much, and that was an amateur
concert at the British Legation that evening, at
which she was to sing, and for which she had been
preparing earnestly for weeks. Singing, to her, was
the keenest edge of enjoyment. She had begun to
feel the delight of the applause, of the footlights,
already in anticipation. It is true it was only an
amateur concert&mdash;but it would be before an audience
that was worthy of anybody’s efforts&mdash;for was
not everybody, even the President and his wife, to be
present? And Madame Volkonsky had speedily
found out that she would have no rival. She had
looked forward with intense anticipation to this
triumph&mdash;the one pleasure without alloy&mdash;the one
chance of being justly admired and applauded. But
in the last hour all had been forgotten. Even the
artist’s instinct was quenched. She turned cold at
the idea of singing that night. But with her husband,
she felt it was no time to quail. Then Volkonsky
explained to her that he must meet Pembroke
at six, and would afterward dine alone at
home, while she would be on her way to the concert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“And Elise,” he said&mdash;he rarely called her by
her name&mdash;“while there is yet hope&mdash;for he has not
so far done anything, and I think he would not
willingly make you miserable&mdash;if you have an opportunity,
make&mdash;make an appeal to him.”</p>

<p>Before, when the danger had not been so immediate,
she had derided him to his face for this, but
now, like him, she was ready to do anything. The
sweets of her position had grown upon her. For
the first time in her life she had commanded instead
of asking admiration and attention. She made
no promises, but Volkonsky knew that she was
thoroughly frightened.</p>

<p>They went home, and Madame Volkonsky, directing
that she be excused to visitors that day, went
to her room. Like all people who have something
to conceal, she hated and dreaded to be seen when
an emergency was at hand. She lay all day on the
sofa in her bedroom, ostensibly resting and preparing
for the concert of that night&mdash;but she did
not sing a note, and the professor of music, who
came for a last rehearsal, was ruthlessly turned
away like everybody else. In the midst of her own
misery, Olivia Berkeley’s calm and luminous face
haunted her. Olivia’s destiny was not a particularly
brilliant one&mdash;the daughter of a Virginia country
gentleman of modest fortune, condemned to a
humdrum life for the best part of the year&mdash;already
past her first youth&mdash;and Madame Volkonsky,
wife of the Russian Minister, twice as beautiful as
Olivia, gifted and admired&mdash;apparently everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
was on Madame Volkonsky’s side. And the two
had begun life under much the same auspices.
Madame Volkonsky, who was a clever woman in
her way, was not silly enough to suppose that her
present miseries had any real connection with the
honors and pleasures she enjoyed. But being a
shrewd observer, she saw that the excellent things
of life are much more evenly divided than people
commonly fancy&mdash;and she believed in a kind of inexorable
fate that metes out dyspepsia and ingratitude
and deceit to Dives, that the balance may be
struck between him and Lazarus.</p>

<p>So all day she lay on the sofa, and thought about
those early days of hers, and Olivia and Pembroke,
and even her Aunt Sally Peyton and poor Miles and
Cave, and everybody linked with that time. When
she thought of Pembroke, it came upon her that he
might be induced to spare her. She had never
really understood Pembroke, although she had
admired him intensely. If she had, things would
have been very different with both of them. She
never could understand her own failure with him.
Of course she hated him, but love and hatred of
the same person are not unfrequently found in
women. She could not but hate him when she
remembered that if he spared them and let them
get away quietly, it would be because she was a
woman, not because she was Elise Koller. But
after all she would be rather pleased to get away
from Washington now, if she could do so without
being ruined. She wondered at her own rashness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
in returning. It seemed a kind of madness. There
were pleasanter places&mdash;and it brought her early
life and associations too much before her. She was
not fond of reminiscences.</p>

<p>Occasionally as she lay upon the sofa, wrapped
in a silk coverlet and gazing at the cheerful fire
that blazed in the fireplace, she dropped into an
uneasy sleep. This made her nerves recover their
tone, and even somewhat raised her spirits. She
was anxious and very much alarmed, but not in
despair. About four o’clock her husband came
into her room. His face was ashy and he held a
dispatch in his hand.</p>

<p>“The Grand Duke arrives within half an hour.
This dispatch has been delayed several hours. I
go to the train now to meet him.”</p>

<p>Madame Volkonsky sat upright on the sofa.</p>

<p>“Will it make&mdash;any difference to us?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Volkonsky shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“It will simply bring matters to a crisis. It may
restrain Pembroke&mdash;if not, it is his opportunity to
ruin me. I shall of course tell his royal highness
and his suite of the concert, and they may choose
to go. Russians must always be amused. Perhaps
you will have the honor of singing for his royal
highness as well as the President.” His tone as he
said this was not pleasant.</p>

<p>“I met the old Colonel Berkeley just now. He
asked me how Eliza was. Is it that he is a fool or
that he wishes to be impertinent?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>A ghost of a smile came to Madame Volkonsky’s
face. Her husband’s total inability to understand
Anglo-Saxon character, manners, sarcasm and
humor could not but amuse her.</p>

<p>“Colonel Berkeley is not a fool at least,” she
replied.</p>

<p>Volkonsky went out and drove rapidly to the
station. All the people attached to the Russian
Legation were there, and in five minutes the train
rolled in. The Grand Duke and his suite alighted,
and the royal young man, taking Volkonsky’s arm,
entered his carriage and was driven to his hotel.</p>

<p>During all this time, Volkonsky was battling
with his nervousness. He was afraid that the
Grand Duke would invite him to dine&mdash;and in that
case, he would miss Pembroke, and perhaps exasperate
him. However the Grand Duke did not, much
to the Minister’s relief and the attachés’ disgust.
But the concert at the British Legation was mentioned,
and the Grand Duke signified his august
pleasure to attend. The Minister was to call for
him at half-past eight&mdash;just the hour the concert
began, but royalty does not mind little things like
that. As the Grand Duke had not paid his respects
to the President, the attendance at the concert was
a little unofficial affair, that was to be made as informal
as possible&mdash;under the rose as it were. At
a quarter before six Volkonsky got off&mdash;and drove
to the club.</p>

<p>Pembroke had not yet arrived, but the servants
had orders to show M. Volkonsky to a private<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
room, where Mr. Pembroke would join him. This
delay enraged Volkonsky. He thought it was a
premeditated slight on Pembroke’s part to keep
him waiting. He went to the room, however, and
sat down and played with his gloves and waited
impatiently and angrily.</p>

<p>It was nearly half an hour after Volkonsky had
arrived that Pembroke came in looking hurried and
flushed. He did not mind at all crushing Volkonsky,
and could with pleasure have kicked him
into the street, but he was not disposed to the small
revenges, like keeping an enemy waiting. He said
at once:</p>

<p>“Pray excuse my delay. I apologize&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No apology is required,” answered Volkonsky
haughtily; “I have this instant myself arrived. I
have been in attendance upon his royal highness,
the Grand Duke Alexis, who has just reached
town.”</p>

<p>“And I,” responded Pembroke bowing, “have
been in attendance upon his excellency, the President
of the United States&mdash;which of course, obliges
me to postpone any other appointment.”</p>

<p>Volkonsky fancied a lurking smile in the corners
of Pembroke’s mouth. These incomprehensible
Americans, he thought bitterly, never tell people
when they are joking. But Pembroke was in no
joking mood. He sat down by a little table between
them, and looked Volkonsky full in the
eye.</p>

<p>“I have been with the President and the Secretary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
of State, and it is upon your affairs that we
met.”</p>

<p>Volkonsky shifted uneasily in his chair. These
terrible Americans. They outraged all diplomacy.</p>

<p>“And may I ask the result of that conference?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>“Certainly. That if you will agree to go quietly,
you may.”</p>

<p>Volkonsky drew himself up. Pembroke remembered
a similar gesture and attitude in a country
road, some years before.</p>

<p>“And if I decline?”</p>

<p>Pembroke nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“Then the President, through the State Department
will feel compelled to notify your government
of the correspondence of yours which came into the
hands of the Department, and was upon my request
presented to the Foreign Affairs sub-committee.
This is enough, you understand, for your recall, and
perhaps dismissal. But I thought proper to inform
the President of what <i>I</i> knew personally regarding
you&mdash;and I also informed him that your wife was
entitled to some consideration of which you were
totally unworthy. So you had best take advantage
of the President’s leniency in allowing you to go,
without a peremptory demand for your recall.”</p>

<p>“You perhaps have gone too fast,” answered
Volkonsky in a quiet voice&mdash;for the whole conversation
had been conducted in a conversational
key. “You are no doubt aware that the United
States Government is bound by some obligations to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
the Government of the Czar, owing to the stand
taken by Russia during your civil war, when you,
Mr. Pembroke, were in rebellion. If you will
remember, when there seemed a strong probability
that the Confederate government would be recognized
by England and France, the Czar signified,
that if such a contingency arose, he would be prepared
to render the United States active help. As
a guarantee, you will recollect the appearance of
a small Russian fleet off the Pacific Coast. Now,
upon the first occasion that a member of the royal
family comes to the United States, to have a diplomatic
scandal&mdash;to dismiss the Russian Minister the
day after the Grand Duke’s arrival&mdash;when arrangements
are made for the presentations, and certain
formal entertainments&mdash;will certainly be most
awkward, and I may say, embarrassing, for his
royal highness as well as the Russian Government.”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” answered Pembroke. “This phase
of the question was discussed fully by the Secretary
of State, who was present at the interview
with the President. He mentioned that the strongest
proof of friendship this Government could give
the Russian Government would be for the Secretary
to state privately to the Grand Duke how
matters stand, and to offer, on his account, to permit
your presence temporarily in Washington.”</p>

<p>Volkonsky stood up for a moment and sat down
again. His face was quite desperate by this time.
And the amazing audacity of this American!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“How can it be arranged? It is impossible; you
must yield,” he gasped.</p>

<p>“The President himself has arranged everything.
That is,” he added, with some malice, “he agreed
to my proposition, as did the Secretary of State.
The Secretary, to-morrow, will have an interview
with the Grand Duke, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will follow the Grand Duke’s wishes?” eagerly
asked Volkonsky, rising again.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Pembroke, with dignity.
“Such is not the practice of this government.
The Secretary will notify the Grand Duke what the
President is prepared to yield out of courtesy to
the Russian Government, and respect for the Czar’s
family. You will be allowed to present the Grand
Duke to the President, according to the original
programme. But you will be careful not to offer
your hand to the President, or to presume to engage
him in conversation. Don’t forget this.”</p>

<p>“And the State dinner to his royal highness?”
asked Volkonsky, in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>“A card will be sent you, but you must absent
yourself. It was agreed that you had abundant
resources by which you could avoid coming, which
I warn you will not be allowed. You might be
called away from Washington upon imperative
business.”</p>

<p>“Or I might be ill. It would perhaps be the
best solution of the difficulty if I should be taken
ill now, and remain so for the next two weeks.”</p>

<p>Pembroke could not for his life, refrain from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
smiling at this. Volkonsky, however, was far
from smiling. He regarded these things as of
tremendous import.</p>

<p>“And Madame Volkonsky&mdash;and the State dinner?”
he said.</p>

<p>“That,” answered Pembroke, with a bow, “rests
solely with Madame Volkonsky. This government
fights men, not women.”</p>

<p>Volkonsky had been restless, getting up and
walking about, and then sitting down at the table
and resting his face on his hands. Pembroke had
not moved from his first position, which was one
of easy dignity. Presently Volkonsky burst out
with:</p>

<p>“But did the President himself say anything of
me?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“Then I insist on hearing it.”</p>

<p>“M. Volkonsky, it would do you no good.
The arrangements I have told you of are final, and
I will be present with other members of the Foreign
Affairs Committee at your meeting with the
President.”</p>

<p>Volkonsky at once thought that the President
had said something which was favorable to him.
He said violently:</p>

<p>“But I demand to know. I am still the accredited
Minister of all the Russias. I have certain
rights, which must be respected. I demand to
know the President’s exact language.”</p>

<p>“M. Volkonsky, I expressly disclaim any sympathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
with the President’s remarks. His language
is far from diplomatic. He did not expect it to be
repeated.”</p>

<p>“I demand to know,” shouted Volkonsky, furiously.</p>

<p>“He said, he knew you were an infernal scoundrel
the instant he put his eyes on you.”</p>

<p>Volkonsky fell back in his chair almost stunned.
Pembroke, whose sense of humor was struggling
with his anger and disgust, almost felt sorry for
him. After a pause, Volkonsky raised himself up
and looked fixedly at Pembroke.</p>

<p>“Why do you not enter the diplomatic service?”
he said. “You have great talents in that direction.”</p>

<p>“Because,” answered Pembroke, smiling in a way
that made Volkonsky feel like strangling him,
“the diplomatic service is no career for a man&mdash;”</p>

<p>“In America, yes. But in Europe?”</p>

<p>“Nor in Europe, either. Before the railroad and
the telegraph, Ministers had powers and responsibilities.
Now, they are merely agents and messengers.
However, we will not discuss that. Our
affairs are finished. I only have to warn you not
to abuse the reasonable indulgence of this government.
You are to take yourself off&mdash;and if not,
you will be driven out.”</p>

<p>After Volkonsky left him, Pembroke dined
alone at the club. He felt singularly depressed.
As long as he had Volkonsky before him, he
enjoyed the pleasure of beating his enemy according
to the savage instincts which yet dwell in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
human breast. Volkonsky gone, he began to think
with a certain remorse of Elise. The thought of
her misery gave him pain.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered the concert. He recollected
that Miles had engaged for both of them to
go with Colonel Berkeley and Olivia. But for
Miles, he would have excused himself from his
engagement&mdash;but the boy could seldom be induced
to go anywhere, and he had seemed eager to go to
this place&mdash;but not without Olivia. For she had
the gentle tact to make him feel at ease. She
screened him from the curious and unthinking&mdash;he
did not feel lost and abashed with Olivia as he did
without her. So Pembroke finished his dinner
hurriedly, and went back to his lodgings, where
Miles was awaiting him, after having dined alone&mdash;and
in a little while they were at the Colonel’s
house, where Olivia came out on her father’s arm,
and the big landau, brought from Isleham, with
Petrarch on the box as of old, rolled along toward
the British Legation and took its place in line.</p>

<p>When they reached the brilliantly lighted ball-room,
where a concert stage had been erected and
chairs arranged in rows, Pembroke took Miles’
usual place at Olivia’s side. He always felt with
her, the charm of a sweet reasonableness and refinement.
After the man he had talked with, and the
thoughts and evil passions he had just experienced,
it was refreshment to sit beside Olivia Berkeley, to
look into her clear eyes and to listen to her soft
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>The great ball-room was full and very brilliant.
Pembroke looked and felt distrait. He was glad it
was a concert, and that he could sit still and be
silent, instead of moving about and being obliged
to talk. He had altogether forgotten Madame
Volkonsky’s connection with it until he saw her
name on the programme. It gave him an unpleasant
shock&mdash;and presently there was a slight commotion,
and the British Minister escorted the President
and his wife up the room to the arm-chairs
placed for them&mdash;and a few minutes after, the
Grand Duke and his suite&mdash;and in the suite Pembroke
saw Volkonsky.</p>

<p>Olivia did not look at Volkonsky as he passed.
He always excited strong repulsion in her. Then
the music began.</p>

<p>It was a very ordinary concert, as concerts are
apt to be by very distinguished persons. The programme
was long and amateurish. But when
Madame Volkonsky’s first number was reached
the audience waked up. She was the only artist in
the lot.</p>

<p>She came on the stage smiling and bowing, which
raised the applause that greeted her to a storm.
She need not have wished a better foil for her art
as well as her manner and appearance than those
who had preceded her. It had been her terror,
amid all the pleasure of exhibiting her accomplishments,
that the professional would be too obvious.
She was always afraid that some practised
eye&mdash;which indeed sometimes happened&mdash;would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
discover that her art was no amateur’s art. But to-night
she was troubled by nothing like this. She
knew all. She knew that invited to the house of
the President, she could not go&mdash;she knew that she
must slip away like a criminal from her own country,
and from those very men and women who now
admired and envied her. She had married Ahlberg
deliberately, knowing who he was, and had schemed
with him and for him. She had done nothing very
wrong, she had said to herself, a dozen times that
day&mdash;nothing but to prefer present interest to ever-lasting
principles&mdash;nothing but to join her fate with
full knowledge, to a scoundrel&mdash;nothing but to have
preferred money and pleasure and crooked ways to
the straight. Meanwhile many women did as she
did and were not so cruelly punished. But fate
had overtaken her. No fear now lest people
should know she was once a professional singer&mdash;they
would know all about her soon enough. She
knew that the storm that would break upon her
was only delayed a little. She would therefore
enjoy to the most this last time&mdash;this one feast
at the king’s table. She sang her best&mdash;sang as
if inspired, and in the subtile harmonies, the
deep mysterious cries, the passionate meaning of
Schumann and Schubert, her soul found utterance
through her voice. Had she been permitted to sing
thus always&mdash;had that glorious but capricious voice
always remained like that, she would have been a
proud and satisfied artist, instead of this trembling
and disappointed worldling, about to be hurled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
from her place in the eyes of the world she loved
and feared so much.</p>

<p>The applause, which soon became as wild and
earnest as if it were a real stage, warmed her and
brought the red blood to her face. She bowed right
and left with the grace and precision of one trained
to receive applause beautifully. Then in response
to the tremendous encores, she sang a little German
song&mdash;so simple, so low and clear, that it sounded
like a mother’s lullaby. Even those arrayed against
her felt the spell of her thrilling voice. Olivia
Berkeley, who had always antagonized her strongly,
felt her cheeks flush and her heart trembled with a
kind of remorse.</p>

<p>Pembroke was pierced again, and more strongly,
by the self-accusing spirit that this woman was to
be stricken by his hand. He felt himself right in
what he had done&mdash;but neither happy, nor self-approving,
nor guiltless.</p>

<p>The rest of the concert seemed tamer than ever.
When it was over there was to be a supper to a few
invited guests. When the music came to an end,
Pembroke rose, glad to get away from Madame
Volkonsky’s presence. But just then the British
Minister came up and asked Colonel Berkeley and
Olivia and the two Pembrokes to remain. Olivia
accepted, but Pembroke was about to decline. He
had begun in a deprecatory way, when Olivia said
smiling, “You will be sorry if you go.” Something
in the tone, in the expression of her eye, conveyed
more than the simple words, and fixed the fact in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
an instant that he would remain. He accepted, and
almost before he knew it, he found himself near
Madame Volkonsky, and the host invited him to
give her his arm to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Like most women of her nature, Madame Volkonsky
had a blind dependence upon what she
called fate&mdash;which means upon any accidental conjunction
of circumstances. She had been turning
over in her mind, eagerly and feverishly, all day
long the chances of five minutes’ talk with Pembroke.
She had not been able to hit upon anything
that would insure it that night, because she
had no warrant that she should see him&mdash;and even
if he came to the concert, it was a chance whether
he would remain to the supper. Again, everything
pointed to one of the diplomatic corps taking her
into supper&mdash;and only the charming indifference
which the diplomatic corps manifests at Washington
to diplomatic usages, could pair the wife of the
Russian Minister with a young member of Congress.
But in truth, the British Minister and all
his diplomatic colleagues had got wind of what was
coming, and it was an opportunity of giving Volkonsky
a kick which pleased them all. The supper
was quite informal, and the Grand Duke did not
remain.</p>

<p>In the first flush of her joy at having a word with
Pembroke, Madame Volkonsky entirely forgot the
slight offered her by barring her out of a diplomatic
escort. She was seated at a little round
table where sat Ryleief, and by another strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
turn of fate, Olivia Berkeley. Madame Volkonsky
had drawn off her long black gloves and was
talking to Pembroke with smiling self-possession,
when she remembered that however Pembroke
might rank as a man, she was entitled to go out to
supper with a person of diplomatic rank. The
British Minister might play tricks, as all of the
diplomats did, with the Americans, but among
themselves, etiquette was strictly observed, even at
small and jolly supper parties. She was so well
pleased with what destiny had done for her in giving
her Pembroke as an escort, that she had no
quarrel with destiny whatever. But with the British
Minister and his wife, she did have a quarrel.
She felt her anger and indignation rising every
moment against them. It was the first stab of the
many she was destined to receive.</p>

<p>Madame Volkonsky had most of the conversation
to herself. Pembroke, in spite of every effort,
felt heavy hearted. Olivia Berkeley was painfully
embarrassed, and it required all her savoir faire to
keep Ryleief from finding it out. As for Ryleief,
he was so taken up with watching his three companions
that he scarcely opened his mouth except
to put something in it.</p>

<p>There was a great pretense of jollity at the little
table&mdash;so much so, that Volkonsky turned from
a remote corner into which he had been shoveled,
with a faint hope that Madame Volkonsky had
accomplished something. He was a hopeful scamp.</p>

<p>At last the opportunity came that Madame Volkonsky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
had longed for. They rose and went back
to the drawing-rooms. She and Pembroke were in
front, and by a gesture she stopped him in a recess
under the broad staircase, that was half concealed
by great palms. Perhaps Pembroke might have
had a weak moment&mdash;but as Olivia passed him on
Ryleief’s arm, though she avoided his glance he saw
her face&mdash;he saw a kind of gentle scorn in her delicate
nostril&mdash;a shade of contempt that hardened
his heart toward Madame Volkonsky on the instant.</p>

<p>In a moment or two everybody but themselves
had gone. They were virtually alone.</p>

<p>“Pembroke,” said Madame Volkonsky. The
tone, and the piercing look which accompanied it,
had all the virtue of sincerity.</p>

<p>“You know what I would say,” she continued.
“You have everything in your hands. You may
drive me away from here&mdash;away from respectable
society&mdash;away from all that makes life tolerable.
What have I done to you that you should deny me
mercy?”</p>

<p>“But I can do nothing now,” responded Pembroke.
“It is too late. And besides I have done
very little. If I may say it, M. Volkonsky has
done it all himself.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Madame Volkonsky. “It is
true he has done it all. But surely, you might
make some plea. At least you might try. Oh,
you cannot know what it is to feel one’s self sinking,
sinking, and not a hand held out to save.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>Pembroke’s face was quite impassive, but his soul
was not so impassive. It cost him much to withstand
the entreaties of a woman&mdash;and a woman
who fancied she had some claim upon him, although
in the bottom of his heart, he knew that he had
got more trouble, pain and annoyance from Elise
Koller than he had pleasure by a great deal&mdash;more
bad than good&mdash;more war than peace.</p>

<p>“Madame Volkonsky,” he continued, after a
pause, “you are putting your appeal on the wrong
ground. You will find that your husband has been
mercifully dealt with&mdash;and that mercy was for your
sake alone. Had you married him in ignorance&mdash;but
Elise, you knew him as well five years ago as
now.”</p>

<p>Pembroke feared that his tone did not convey his
unalterable decision, but it did, indeed, to the
unfortunate woman before him.</p>

<p>“There is no pity in the world,” she began&mdash;and
then kept on, gasping with hysterical excitement.
“No pity at all. I thought that you at least had a
heart&mdash;but you are as cold&mdash;I never asked for mercy
in my life that I was not denied. Even when I
humiliated myself before Olivia Berkeley.”</p>

<p>In the midst of her own frenzy of despair, she
saw something in Pembroke’s face that forced her
to stop there. She was trembling violently and
gasping for breath. Every moment he thought she
would break into cries and screams. He took her
firmly by the arm and led her to a side door, and
out to where the street was blocked with carriages.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Madame Volkonsky submitted without a word. It
was useless. He was always so prompt. He had no
hat, nor had Madame Volkonsky any wrap around
her. He called for the Russian Minister’s carriage,
and in a moment it came. He placed Madame
Volkonsky in it, and she obeyed him silently.
Her head hung down, she wept a little, and was
the picture of despair.</p>

<p>“Now, wait for the Minister,” he said to the
coachman&mdash;and he sent the footman for Madame
Volkonsky’s wrap.</p>

<p>Then he went back in the house, and through
the drawing-rooms until he saw Volkonsky. “You
had better go at once to your wife. She is waiting
in her carriage,” he said.</p>

<p>Volkonsky did not take time even to bid his
host good-night, but slipped out, Pembroke a little
behind him. When they reached the carriage,
Madame Volkonsky was inside weeping violently.
Pembroke had not got her out a moment too
soon.</p>

<p>Volkonsky looked at Pembroke for a moment.
“Madame has not her wrap,” he said. “She has a
mantle of sable that cost&mdash;ah, here is the footman
with it.” Pembroke turned away sick at heart.</p>

<p>Within a week the Grand Duke’s visit was over,
and the Russian Legation was suddenly turned
over to Ryleief. The Minister was ill, and his doctors
ordered him to the south of France. The
day before Madame Volkonsky left Washington,
a parcel was delivered into her hands. It was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
rouleau containing a considerable sum of money.
There was nothing to indicate where it came from.</p>

<p>“It must have cost a good deal of self-denial for
Pembroke to send me this,” she said, after counting
the money. “He is not a rich man. It will perhaps
serve me in some dreadful emergency”&mdash;for
she had learned to expect dreadful emergencies by
that time.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Washington</span> society did not see much of Pembroke
that winter. He worked very hard, and in
the afternoons he took long, solitary rides. Sometimes
in his rides he would meet Olivia Berkeley,
generally with her father, and often Miles was with
them. Then he would join the cavalcade, and exert
himself to be gay&mdash;for it cannot be denied that
he was not in very good spirits at that time. It is
one thing to perform an act of rigid justice and
another to take pleasure in it. Madame Volkonsky’s
last words rang in his ears.</p>

<p>He could not but smile at Olivia. She pierced
his outward pretense of gayety, and saw that at
heart he was sad. She fancied she knew why. By
a mighty effort she brought herself to regard his
infatuation for Madame Volkonsky with pity.</p>

<p>“It is written that Olivia shall always misunderstand
me,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>The Volkonsky matter did not end there. The
treatment of the Russian representative suddenly
presented a party phase. The party in power saw
that capital could be made out of it. Pembroke
had carried the whole thing through. Pembroke
was a Southern man. Russia had offered her fleet
during the civil war, in the event that France and
England should depart from the strictest neutrality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
It was easy enough to make the Russian Minister,
who had departed, a martyr. In those unhappy
days of sectional strife, these things were seized
upon eagerly by both sides.</p>

<p>Pembroke heard that an attack was to be made
upon him on the floor of the House. This gave
him great satisfaction. He knew that his course
was not only justifiable but patriotic in the highest
degree. The question of Volkonsky’s iniquities in
the first instance had been thrust upon him by his
political adversaries in the committee, who thought
it at best but a diplomatic squabble. The sub-committee
to which it was referred, had a chairman who
was taken ill early in the session, and was not able
to attend any of the committee meetings. His
other colleague was incurably lazy&mdash;so this supposed
trifling matter was wholly in his hands, and
it had turned out a first-class sensation.</p>

<p>The visit of the Grand Duke, and the complications
from Russia’s extreme friendliness toward the
Government at a critical time, had suddenly made
the question assume a phase of international importance.
Without scandal, and without giving offense,
the State Department, acting on Pembroke’s information,
had managed to rout Volkonsky, and
incidentally to give a warning to continental governments
regarding the men they should send as diplomatic
representatives to the United States. The
Secretary of State, a cold, formal, timid, but dignified
man, was infinitely gratified and relieved at the manner
in which Pembroke had managed Volkonsky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>The President had laughed with grim humor at the
account of Volkonsky’s utter rout. Altogether it
was a chain of successes for Pembroke, and it gave
him his opportunity to show the debater’s stuff
there was in him. Therefore, when he was informed
that on a certain day he would have to answer for
himself on the floor of the House, he felt in high
spirits, for the first time in weeks.</p>

<p>Miles was full of excitement. Colonel Berkeley,
whose sectionalism was of the robust and aggressive
kind indigenous in Virginia, was in high
feather. He charged Pembroke repeatedly to wallop
those infernal Yankees so that they would never
forget it, and recalled all the forensic glories of all
the Pembrokes to him. Olivia brightened into wonderful
interest. She said it was the subject that
interested her.</p>

<p>The evening before the resolution was to be
called up, Pembroke walked over to the Berkeleys,
Olivia and her father sat in the cosy library. The
Colonel began immediately.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, you ought not to be here this
minute. Remember you have got to speak for the
State of Virginia to-morrow. You ought to be
sharpening your blade and seeing to the joints in
your armor.”</p>

<p>“You should, indeed,” struck in Olivia, with
great animation. “You can’t imagine how nervous
I feel. You see, you are to be the mouth-piece of
all of us. If you don’t do your best, and show that
we have some patriotism, as well as the North, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
believe there will be a general collapse among all
the Southern people here.”</p>

<p>Pembroke could not help laughing.</p>

<p>“Your anxiety, Colonel, and Miss Berkeley’s
doesn’t bespeak great confidence in me.”</p>

<p>Olivia blushed and protested more earnestly.</p>

<p>“Not so, not so, sir,” cried the Colonel. “We
have every confidence in you, but my boy, you had
better take a look at Cicero’s orations against Catiline&mdash;and
read over to-night Sheridan’s speeches&mdash;and
Hayne against Webster.”</p>

<p>Pembroke threw himself back in his chair, and
his laugh was so boyish and hearty, that Olivia was
startled into joining in it.</p>

<p>“This is fearful,” said Olivia, bringing her pretty
brows together sternly. “This is unpardonable
levity. At a time like this, it is dreadful for
us to stand so in awe of your self-love. Really
now, we know that you are eloquence and cleverness
itself, but it isn’t safe,” she continued, with
an air of infinite experience, “to trust anything to
chance.”</p>

<p>“Come down to the House to-morrow and encourage
me,” replied Pembroke good humoredly, “and
keep up Miles’ spirits when I begin to flounder.”</p>

<p>The evening was very jolly, like those old ones
in Paris and in Virginia. Pembroke at last rose to
go, and in parting, the Colonel clapped him on the
back, while Olivia held his hand and pressed it so
warmly that Pembroke’s dark face colored with
pleasure, as she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“Now, I know I am offending you&mdash;but you
can’t imagine how frightened I am. You may
come out all right&mdash;but the suspense will be dreadful&mdash;”
She was laughing, too, but Pembroke saw
under her badinage a powerful interest in his success.
He went away elated. “At least she will
see that I was worthy of more consideration than
she gave me,” he thought&mdash;a common reflection to
men who have been refused.</p>

<p>Next day the floor of the House was crowded
and the galleries packed. Administration and anti-administration
people were interested. Society
turned out in force to hear the revelations about
the late Russian Minister&mdash;the private and diplomatic
galleries were filled. The Senate was not in
session, and many Senators were on the floor.</p>

<p>After the morning hour, and the droning through
of some unimportant business, the leader of the
majority rose, and demanded the consideration of
the resolution of inquiry relating to the recall of
the Russian Minister from this country. At that a
hush fell upon the crowd. The leader of the opposition
rose to reply. He stated briefly that it was
a matter concerning the Foreign Affairs Committee,
and a member of one of the sub-committees had
sole charge of it owing to the illness of the chairman.
Another member then rose, and sarcastically
referring to the fact that the gentleman referred to
could scarcely be supposed to entertain friendly
feelings toward the representative of the only foreign
government which showed the slightest sympathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
toward the Union in the Civil War, demanded
to know by what right had the Russian Minister’s
position in Washington been made untenable&mdash;and
that too, at the time of the visit of a member of
the Czar’s family&mdash;and was this the return the
United States Government made for the Czar’s
extreme friendliness? Then Pembroke stood up
in his place, at a considerable distance from the
Speaker. This gave him a great advantage, for it
showed the fine resonant quality of his voice, clear
and quite free from rant and harshness. Olivia
Berkeley, who watched him from the front row in
the gallery, saw that he was pale, but perfectly self-possessed.
As he caught her eye, in rising, he
smiled at her.</p>

<p>“Mr. Speaker.”</p>

<p>The Speaker fixed his piercing eyes upon him,
and with a light tap of the gavel, said “The gentleman
from Virginia has the floor.”</p>

<p>Pembroke used no notes. He began in a clear and
dignified manner to recite the part taken by him in
Volkonsky’s case&mdash;his suspicions, his demand for
documents from the State Department, Volkonsky’s
compromising letters, of which he read copies&mdash;the
dilemma of the Department, anxious not to
offend Russia but indignant at the baseness of Volkonsky&mdash;the
further complication of the Grand
Duke’s visit, and all which followed. He then read
his statement of what had occurred at his interviews
with Volkonsky, and which he had filed at
the State Department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“And here let me say,” he remarked, pausing
from the reading of his minutes of his last conversation
with Volkonsky, “that in some of my
language and stipulations I had no authority from
either the President or Secretary of State&mdash;but
with the impetuosity of all honest men, I felt a
profound indignation at a man of the late Minister’s
character, daring to present himself as an
accredited agent to this Government. In many of
these instances, as for example, when I stipulated
that the late Minister should not presume to shake
hands with the President at his parting interview,
or address him in any way, no doubt the late
Minister supposed that I was instructed to make
that stipulation. Sir, I was not. It was an outburst
of feeling. I felt so clearly that no man of
Volkonsky’s character should be permitted to
touch the hand of the President of the United
States, that I said so&mdash;and said so in such a way
that the late Minister supposed I had the President’s
authority for it.”</p>

<p>At this, there was an outburst of applause. The
Speaker made no move to check it. Pembroke
bowed slightly, and resumed in his calm and piercing
voice.</p>

<p>Members of the House and Senate had settled
themselves to hear a speech. In five minutes the
old stagers had found out that there was the making
of a great parliamentary speaker in this stalwart
dark young man. Members leaned back and
touched each other. Pens refrained from scratching.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
The pages, finding nothing to do, crept toward the
Speaker’s desk and sat down on the carpeted steps.
One little black-eyed fellow fixed his gaze on
Pembroke’s face, and at the next point he made,
the page, without waiting for his elders, suddenly
clapped furiously. A roar of laughter and applause
followed. Pembroke smiled, and did not break
silence again until the Speaker gave him a slight
inclination of the head. In that pause he had
glanced at Olivia in the gallery. Her face was
crimson with pride and pleasure.</p>

<p>Outside in the corridors, the word had gone
round that there was something worth listening to
going on inside. The aisles became packed. A
slight disturbance behind him showed Pembroke
that a contingent of women was being admitted to
the floor&mdash;and before him, in the reporters’ gallery,
where men were usually moving to and fro, every
man was at his post, and there was no passing in
and out.</p>

<p>Pembroke began to feel a sense of triumph. His
easy, but forcible delivery was not far from eloquence.
He felt the pulse of his audience, as it
were. At first, when he began, it was entirely cold
and critical, while his blood leaped like fire through
his veins, and it took all his will-power to maintain
his appearance of coolness. But as his listeners
warmed up, he cooled off. The more subtly he
wrought them up, the more was he master of himself.
His nerve did not once desert him.</p>

<p>Gradually he began to lead up to where he hoped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
to make his point&mdash;that, although of the party in
opposition, he felt as deeply, and resented as instantly,
any infringement of the dignity of the Government
as any citizen of the republic&mdash;and that
such was the feeling in his party. His own people
saw his lead and applauded tremendously. Just
then the Speaker’s gavel fell. Loud cries of “Go
on! Go on! Give him half an hour more! Give
him an hour!” rang out. Pembroke had ceased in
the middle of a sentence, and had sat down.</p>

<p>“Is there objection to the gentleman from
Virginia continuing?” asked the Speaker, in an
animated voice. “The Chair hears none. The
gentleman will proceed.”</p>

<p>The applause now turned into cheers and shouts.
One very deaf old gentleman moved forward to
Pembroke and, deliberately motioning a younger
man out of his seat, quietly took possession of it, to
the amusement of the House. The little page,
who was evidently a pet of the old gentleman,
stole up to him and managed to crowd in the same
chair. Shouts of laughter followed this, followed
by renewed applause for Pembroke, in which his
opponents good-naturedly joined. Then Pembroke
felt that the time had come. He had the House
with him.</p>

<p>He spoke for an hour. He merely took the
Volkonsky incident for a text. He spoke of the
regard for the common weal exhibited by his party,
and he vigorously denounced his opponents for
their attempt to make party capital out of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
which was near and dear to all Americans. He
spoke with temper and judgment, but his party
realized that they had gained a powerful aid in
their fight with the majority. At the last he artfully
indulged in one burst of eloquence&mdash;in which
he seemed carried away by his theme, but in which,
like a genuine orator, he played upon his audience,
and while they imagined that he had forgotten
himself he was watching them. Truly they had
forgotten everything but the ringing words of the
speaker. He had touched the chord of true
Americanism which sweeps away all parties, all
prejudices. Then, amidst prolonged and vociferous
cheering, he sat down. Senators and Representatives
closed around him, congratulating him and
shaking hands. The House was in no mood for
anything after that, and a motion to adjourn was
carried, nobody knew how. When at last, to escape
being made to appear as if he remained to be
congratulated, Pembroke was going toward the
cloak room the Speaker passed near him and advanced
and offered his hand. “Ah,” he cried, in his
pleasant, jovial way, “right well have you acquitted
yourself this day. You’ll find much better company
on our side of the House, however, my young
friend.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Pembroke, smiling and bowing
to the great man. “It’s not bad on my own
side.”</p>

<p>The Speaker laughed and passed on.</p>

<p>Pembroke slipped out. It was a pleasant spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
afternoon. The world took on for him a glorious
hue just then, as it does to every man who finds
his place in life, and that place an honorable one.
But one thing was wanting&mdash;a tender heart to
sympathize with him at that moment. Instead of
turning toward his lodgings, he walked away into
the country&mdash;away where he could see the blue
line of the Virginia hills. It gave him a kind of
malicious satisfaction, and was yet pain to him,
that Olivia would be expecting him, and that she
should be disappointed. As the hero of the hour
she would naturally want to greet him.</p>

<p>“Well,” he thought, as he struck out more vigorously
still, “let us see if my lady will not peak
and pine a little at being forgotten.” And yet her
hurt gave him hurt, too. Love and perversity are
natural allies.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when he returned to his lodgings.
Miles was not there&mdash;gone to dinner with
the Berkeleys.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock Miles turned up, the proudest
younger brother in all America. He had all that
he had heard to tell his brother. But presently he
asked:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come to the Berkeleys’? The
Colonel kept the carriage waiting at the Capitol
for you. Olivia listened at dinner for your step,
and jumped up once, thinking you had come.”</p>

<p>“I needed a walk in the country,” answered
Pembroke, sententiously.</p>

<p>Miles sighed. A look came into his poor face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
that Pembroke had seen there before&mdash;a look that
made the elder brother’s strong heart ache. Any
disappointment to Olivia was a stab to this unfortunate
young soul. Men, as nature made them,
are not magnanimous in love. Only some frightful
misfortune like this poor boy’s can make them
so.</p>

<p>Presently Miles continued, hesitatingly:</p>

<p>“You must go to see her very early to-morrow.
You know they return to Virginia early in the
week.”</p>

<p>“I can’t go,” answered Pembroke, wounding
himself, and the brother that he loved better than
himself, in order to wound Olivia. “I must go to
New York early to-morrow morning, on business.
I was notified ten days ago.”</p>

<p>Miles said no more.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Pembroke was off, leaving
a note for Olivia, which that young lady showed
her father, and then, running up to her own room,
tore into bits&mdash;and then she burst into tears. And
yet it was a most kind, cordial, friendly note. When
Pembroke returned, the Berkeleys had left town for
the season.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> quaint old house, and the straggling, half-kept
grounds at Isleham were never lovelier than
that spring. Sometimes the extreme quiet and
repose had weighed upon Olivia’s spirits as it would
upon any other young and vigorous nature. But
now she had a good deal of a certain sort of excitement.
She was country-bred, and naturally
turned to the country for any home feeling she
might have. The Colonel and Petrarch were a
little bored at first. Both missed the social life at
Washington. Pete had been a success in his own
circle. His ruffled shirt-front, copied from his
master’s, had won infinite respect among his own
color. As for the natty white footmen and coachmen,
their opinion and treatment, even their jeers,
he regarded with lofty indifference, and classed
them as among the poorest of poor white trash.</p>

<p>His religion, too, had struck terror to those of the
Washington darkies to whom he had had a chance
to expound it. His liberal promises of eternal
damnation, “an’ sizzlin’ an’ fryin’ in perdition, wid
de devil bastin’ ’em wid de own gravy,” had not
lost force even through much repetition. “Ole
marse,” Petrarch informed Olivia, “he cuss ’bout
dem dam towns, an’ say he aint had nuttin’ fittin’
ter eat sence he lef’ Verginny. Ole marse, he jis’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
maraudin’ an’ cussin’ ’cause he aint got nuttin’ ter
do. I lay he gwi’ back naix’ year. Ef he does, I
got some preachments ter make ter dem wuffless
niggers d’yar, totin’ de sins ’roun’ like twuz’ gol’
an’ silver.”</p>

<p>It seemed as if Olivia were destined to suffer a
good deal of secret mortification on Pembroke’s account.
That last neglect of his had cut her to the
soul. She had waked up to the fact, however, that
Pembroke had taken his first rebuff in good earnest,
and that nothing was left for her but that hollow
pretense of friendship which men and women
who have been, or have desired to be, more to
each other, must affect. It was rather a painful
and uncomfortable feeling to take around with her,
when listening to Mrs. Peyton’s vigorous talk, or the
Rev. Mr. Cole’s harmless sermons, and still more
harmless conversation. But it was there, and it
was unconquerable, and she must simply adjust
the burden that she might bear it.</p>

<p>The county was full of talk about Pembroke’s
speech. The older people were sure that some information
of his father’s great speeches in their
court-house about 1849 must have reached Washington,
and that Pembroke’s future was predicated
upon them. Then there was a good deal in the
newspapers about it. The Richmond papers
printed the speech in full, together with a genealogical
sketch of his family since the first Pembroke
came over, with a grant of land from Charles the
Second in his pocket. Likewise, Pembroke’s success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
was attributed almost wholly to his ancestry,
and he himself was considered to have had a merely
nominal share in it.</p>

<p>It was the long session of Congress, and there
was no talk of Pembroke’s returning to the county.
Whenever he did come, though, it was determined
to give him a public dinner.</p>

<p>One afternoon in May, about the same time of
year that Pembroke and Olivia had had their
pointed conversation in the garden, Olivia was
trimming her rose-bushes. She was a famous gardener,
and a part of every morning and afternoon
she might have been found looking after her shrubs
and flowers. Sometimes, with a small garden hoe,
she might have been seen hoeing vigorously, much
to Petrarch’s disgust, who remonstrated vainly.</p>

<p>“Miss ’Livy, yo’ mar never did no sech a thing.
When she want hoein’ done, she sen’ fur Susan’s
Torm, an’ Simon Peter an’ Unc’ Silas’ Jake. She
didn’t never demean herself wid no hoe in her
han’.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t got Susan’s Tom, nor Simon
Peter nor Uncle Silas’ Jake. And besides, I am
doing it because I like it.”</p>

<p>“Fur Gord A’mighty’s sake, Miss ’Livy, doan’
lemme hear dat none o’ de Berkeleys likes fur ter
wuk. De Berkeleys allus wuz de gentlefolks o’ de
county. Didn’t none on ’em like ter wuk. Ketch ole
marse wukkin! Gord warn’t conjurin’ ’bout de fust
families when He say, ‘By de sweat o’ de brow dey
shall scuffle fer de vittals.’ He mos’ p’intedly warn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
studyin’ ’bout de Berkeleys, ’kase dey got dat high
an’ mighty sperrit dey lay down an’ starve ’fo’ dey
disqualify deyselfs by wukkin’.”</p>

<p>But Olivia stuck bravely to her plebeian amusement.
On this particular afternoon she was not
hoeing. She was merely snipping off straggling
wisps from the great rose-trees&mdash;old-fashioned
“maiden’s blush,” and damasks. She was thinking,
as, indeed, she generally did when she found herself
employed in that way, of Pembroke and that
unlucky afternoon six years ago.</p>

<p>Before she knew it Pembroke was advancing up
the garden walk. In a moment they were shaking
hands with a great assumption of friendliness.
Olivia could not but wonder if he remembered the
similarity between that and just such another
spring afternoon in the same place. Pembroke
looked remarkably well and seemed in high spirits.</p>

<p>“The Colonel was out riding&mdash;and I did not
need Pete’s directions to know that you were very
likely pottering among your flowers at this time.”</p>

<p>“Pottering is such a senile kind of a word&mdash;you
make me feel I am in my dotage. Doddering is
the next step to pottering. And this, I remember,
is the first chance I have had to congratulate you
in person on your speech. Papa gives your father
and your grandfather the whole credit. I asked
him, however, when he wrote you to give my congratulations.”</p>

<p>“Which he did. It was a very cold and clammy
way of felicitating a friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>Olivia said nothing, but she could not restrain an
almost imperceptible lifting of the brows.</p>

<p>“The result of that speech has been,” continued
Pembroke, after a little pause, “that I am in public
life to stay as long as I can. That means that I
shall never be a rich man. Honest men, in these
times, don’t get rich on politics.”</p>

<p>A brilliant blush came into Olivia’s face at that.
In the midst of suggestive circumstances Pembroke
seemed determined to add suggestive remarks.</p>

<p>“But I hardly think you could take that into
consideration,” she answered, after a moment. “A
man’s destiny is generally fixed by his talents.
You will probably not make a great fortune, but you
may make a great reputation&mdash;and to my way of
thinking the great reputation is the more to be
coveted.”</p>

<p>“Did you always think so?”</p>

<p>“Always.”</p>

<p>Then there came an awkward pause. Olivia was
angry with him for asking the first question, but
Pembroke seemed determined to pursue it.</p>

<p>“Even when I asked you to marry me on this
very spot, six years ago? Then I understood
that you could not marry a poor man.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Olivia, calmly, and facing him,
“you very much misunderstood me. I did think,
as I think now, that poverty is a weight about the
neck of a public man. But I can say truthfully,
that it was <i>your</i> ability to cope with it, rather than
mine, that I feared.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“And it seems to me,” said Pembroke, calmly,
“on looking back, that I was a little too aggressive&mdash;that
I put rather a forced construction on what
you said&mdash;and that I was very angry.”</p>

<p>“I was angry, too&mdash;and it has angered me every
time I have thought of it in these six years, that I
was made to appear mercenary, when I am far from
it&mdash;that a mere want of tact and judgment should
have marked me in your esteem&mdash;or anybody
else’s, for that matter&mdash;as a perfectly cold and calculating
woman.”</p>

<p>She was certainly very angry now.</p>

<p>“But if I was wrong,” said Pembroke, in a low,
clear voice&mdash;for he used the resources of his delightful
voice on poor Olivia as he had done on many
men and some women before&mdash;“I have paid the
price. The humiliation and the pangs of six years
ago were much&mdash;and then, the feeling that, after all,
there was but one woman in the world for me&mdash;ah,
Olivia, sometimes I think you do not know how
deep is the hold you took upon me. You would
have seen in all these years, that however I might
try, I could not forget you.”</p>

<p>Olivia was not implacable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When they came in the house, the Colonel was
come, and in a gale of good humor. He had, however,
great fault to find with Pembroke’s course.
He was too conciliatory&mdash;too willing to forget the
blood shed upon the battlefields of Virginia&mdash;and
then and there they entered upon a political discussion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
which made the old-fashioned mirrors on the
drawing-room wall ring again. The Colonel brought
down his fist and raved. “By Jove, sir, this is intolerable.
My black boy, Petrarch (Petrarch continued
to be the Colonel’s boy), knows more about
the subject than you do; and he’s the biggest fool
I ever saw. I’ll be hanged, sir, if your statements
are worth refuting.” Pembroke withstood the
sortie gallantly, and at intervals charged the enemy
in splendid style, reducing the Colonel to oaths and
splutterings and despair.</p>

<p>Olivia sat in a low chair by the round mahogany
table, on which the old-fashioned lamp burned softly,
casting mellow lights and shades upon her graceful
figure. Occasionally a faint smile played about her
eyes&mdash;whereat Pembroke seemed to gain inspiration,
and attacked the Colonel’s theories with
renewed vigor.</p>

<p>Upon the Colonel’s invitation he remained all
night&mdash;the common mode of social intercourse in
Virginia. Next morning, the Colonel was ripe for
argument. Pembroke, however, to his immense
disgust, refused to enter the lists and spent the
morning dawdling with Olivia in the garden.
About noon, the Colonel, in a rage sent Petrarch
after the renegades. Three times did he return
without them. The fourth time Petrarch’s patience
was exhausted.</p>

<p>“Marse French, fur de Lord’s sake come ter ole
marse. He done got de sugar in de glasses, an’ de
ice cracked up, an’ he fyarly stan’nin’ on he hade.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
He got out all dem ole yaller <i>Richmun Exameters</i>,
printed fo’ de wah, an’ he say he gwi’ bust yo’
argifyins’ all ter pieces. He mighty obstroporous,
an’ you better come along.”</p>

<p>To this pathetic appeal Pembroke at last responded.
Olivia, with downcast face, walked by
his side. The Colonel was very much worked up
and “mighty discontemptuous,” as Petrarch expressed
it.</p>

<p>“This is the third time, sir&mdash;” he began to roar.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Colonel,” replied Pembroke,
laughing. “We will have a plenty of time to quarrel.
Olivia has promised to marry me in the summer.”</p>

<p>“By Gad, sir&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Have a cigar. Now, where did we leave off last
night? Oh, the Virginia Resolutions of 1798.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i><span class="dropcap">O</span>N THE PLANTATION.</i> By <span class="smcap">Joel Chandler Harris</span>, author of
“Uncle Remus.” With 23 Illustrations by <span class="smcap">E. W. Kemble</span>,
and Portrait of the Author. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>The most personal and in some respects
the most important work which
Mr. Harris has published since “Uncle
Remus.” Many will read between the
lines and see the autobiography of the
author. In addition to the stirring incidents
which appear in the story, the author
presents a graphic picture of certain
phases of Southern life which have not
appeared in his books before. There are also new examples of the folk-lore
of the negroes, which became classic when presented to the public in the
pages of “Uncle Remus.”</p>

<p>“The book is in the characteristic vein which has made the author so famous and
popular as an interpreter of plantation character.”&mdash;<i>Rochester Union and Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>“Those who never tire of Uncle Remus and his stories&mdash;with whom we would be
accounted&mdash;will delight in Joe Maxwell and his exploits.”&mdash;<i>London Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>“Altogether a most charming book.”&mdash;<i>Chicago Times.</i></p>

<p>“Really a valuable, if modest, contribution to the history of the civil war within the
Confederate lines, particularly on the eve of the catastrophe. While Mr. Harris, in his
preface, professes to have lost the power to distinguish between what is true and what
is imaginative in his episodical narrative, the reader readily finds the clew. Two or
three new animal fables are introduced with effect; but the history of the plantation, the
printing-office, the black runaways, and white deserters, of whom the impending break-up
made the community tolerant, the coon and fox hunting, forms the serious purpose
of the book, and holds the reader’s interest from beginning to end. Like ‘Daddy Jake,’
this is a good anti slavery tract in disguise, and does credit to Mr. Harris’s humanity.
There are amusing illustrations by E. W. Kemble.”&mdash;<i>New York Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>“A charming little book, tastefully gotten up.... Its simplicity, humor, and individuality
would be very welcome to any one who was weary of the pretentiousness and
the dull obviousness of the average three-volume novel.”&mdash;<i>London Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>“The mirage of war vanishes and reappears like an ominous shadow on the horizon,
but the stay-at-home whites of the Southern Confederacy were likewise threatened by
fears of a servile insurrection. This dark dread exerts its influence on a narration which
is otherwise cheery with boyhood’s fortunate freedom from anxiety, and sublime disregard
for what the morrow may bring forth. The simple chronicle of old times ‘on the
plantation’ concludes all too soon; the fire burns low and the tale is ended just as the
reader becomes acclimated to the mid-Georgian village, and feels thoroughly at home
with Joe and Mink. The ‘Owl and the Birds,’ ‘Old Zip Coon,’ the ‘Big Injun and
the Buzzard,’ are joyous echoes of the plantation-lore that first delighted us in ‘Uncle
Remus.’ Kemble’s illustrations, evidently studied from life, are interspersed in these
pages of a book of consummate charm.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Ledger.</i></p>

Woods</span>, author of “Metzerott, Shoemaker.” 12mo. Cloth,
$1.25.</p>

<p>This book is an original one, like its predecessor, in that it follows none
of the beaten paths of fiction, and it raises questions of vital interest, and
addresses itself to the reader’s thought instead of merely tickling his fancy.
The influence of one human being over another is a subject of curious analysis,
as well as the relation of the individual to the community, a subject, with
its varied amplifications, which is of the first moment to-day. There is a
story, a romance, which will interest novel-readers, but the book will hold
the attention of those for whom the average novel has little charm.</p></div>

Maartens</span>, author of “Joost Avelingh.” 12mo. Cloth, $1.25.</p>

<p>In the opinion of competent critics this new novel by Maarten Maartens
represents the finest development thus far of the author’s powers, and its
appearance in book form promises to cause what is termed in popular parlance
the “literary sensation” of the season. At least, there can be no
question regarding the high appreciation of Maarten Maartens’s work by
American and English readers.</p>

<p>“Maarten Maartens is a capital story-teller.”&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

genuine genius.”&mdash;<i>London Academy.</i></p>

By <span class="smcap">Hall Caine</span>, author of “The Deemster,” “The Scape-Goat,”
etc. 12mo. Cloth, $1.00.</p>

<p>“A new departure by this author. Unlike his previous works, this little tale is
almost wholly humorous, with, however, a current of pathos underneath. It is not
always that an author can succeed equally well in tragedy and in comedy, but it looks
as though Mr. Hall Caine would be one of the exceptions.”&mdash;<i>London Literary World.</i></p>

<p>“Constructed with great ingenuity. The story is full of delight.”&mdash;<i>Boston Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>“It is extremely fortunate that the fine subject indicated in the title should have
fallen into such competent hands.”&mdash;<i>Pittsburgh Chronicle-Telegraph.</i></p>

beautiful and touching study of the character of a girl to love whom proved a liberal
education to both of her admirers.”&mdash;<i>London Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“‘The Faith Doctor’ is worth reading for its style, its wit, and its humor, and not
less, we may add, for its pathos.”&mdash;<i>London Spectator.</i></p>

skill of an experienced artist in fiction. The interest is strong and at times very dramatic....
Those who were attracted by ‘Rutledge’ will give hearty welcome to this
story, and find it fully as enjoyable as that once immensely popular novel.”&mdash;<i>Boston
Saturday Evening Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“In this new story the author has done some of the best work that she has ever
given to the public, and it will easily class among the most meritorious and most
original novels of the year.”&mdash;<i>Boston Home Journal.</i></p>

<p>“The author of ‘Rutledge’ does not often send out a new volume, but when she

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
